Following Reu-\\nben Binns (2017), we take ‘fairness’ in this context to be a placeholder for a vari-\\nety of normative egalitarian considerations. We explore a few fairness measures to \\nsuss out their egalitarian roots and evaluate them, both as formalizations of egali-\\ntarian ideas and as assertions of what fairness demands of predictive systems. We \\npay special attention to a recent and popular fairness measure, counterfactual fair-\\nness, which holds that a prediction about an individual is fair if it is the same in the \\nactual world and any counterfactual world where the individual belongs to a differ-\\nent demographic group (cf. Kusner et\\xa0al. (2018)).\\nKeywords Fair machine learning\\xa0· Egalitarianism\\xa0· Fairness through unawareness\\xa0· \\nEqualized odds\\xa0· Counterfactual fairness\\nIntroduction\\nPrediction-based decisions—decisions based on statistical predictions—influence \\nnearly all aspects of modern life.

These \\nconcerns are not unfounded. Machine learning programs often inherit biases from \\nthe data they are trained on, without any direct influence from their programmers \\n(Johnson 2020). To see what this might look like on the ground, consider Latanya \\nSweeney’s discovery in 2013 that ads by Google AdSense—an advertising service \\nprovided by Google—were more likely to show ad copy suggestive of previous \\narrests (e.g., ‘Trevon Jones, Arrested?’ for the search ‘Trevon Jones’) for searches \\nof names assigned primarily to Black babies, independently of whether the company \\nsponsoring the ad had a criminal record for the searched name (Sweeney 2013).\\nThese sorts of concerns and findings have given rise to the field of fair machine \\nlearning and a number of fairness measures, mathematically precise definitions of \\nfairness that purport to determine whether a given prediction-based decision sys-\\ntem is fair. Note that when the fair machine learning community talks about fairness \\nthey often have something very specific in mind, namely that a system is fair if and \\nonly if it is not wrongfully discriminatory.1 But this characterization of (un)fairness \\nleaves open exactly what standard to use when judging whether a decision is unfair \\nin this way.\\nWhile many proposals have been made as to how to measure fairness in the con-\\ntext of prediction-based decision making, there is little agreement as to which—if \\nany—of these proposals are correct. This is partially explained by the fact that, as \\nBinns (2017, p. 2) has put it, ‘“fairness” as used in the fair machine learning com-\\nmunity is best understood as a placeholder term for a variety of normative egali-\\ntarian considerations’.2 Binns’s insight highlights, we think, the fact that the phrase \\n‘wrongfully discriminatory’ typically expresses an egalitarian standard of wrongful-\\nness, but not always the exact same standard. There are many different egalitarian \\nstandards we might care about, and which ones are operative could vary from con-\\ntext to context. This, in turn, will inform our choice of a fairness measure, which, \\nwe take it, operationalizes the operative standard(s) that we care about in a given \\ncontext. This means—among other things—that there could be a plurality of correct \\nfairness measures, and that the failure of a measure to capture all we care about with \\nrespect to fairness in some context is not enough to show that the measure fails to \\ncapture the relevant fairness concerns in some other context.3\\n1 Note, then, that a ‘fair’ machine could be fair in this sense and yet strike us as unfair in another. For \\ninstance, it might be grossly inaccurate.\\n2 This is no doubt also partially due to the fact that several intuitive measures are incompatible with each \\nother in large ranges of cases, forcing hard choices between measures. For more on this, see Kleinberg \\net\\xa0al. (2016).\\n3 We also think that ‘fairness’ does even more than this. For instance, we think ‘fairness’ is also, at \\ntimes, a placeholder for a less morally laden, statistical sense of ‘fair’ that is synonymous with ‘unbi-\\nased’, in the sense of lacking errors that systematically skew results towards certain types of outcomes \\nover others.\\n239\\n1 3\\nEgalitarian Machine Learning  \\nIn our view, this pluralism about fairness measures is correct. And, in the course \\nof making our argument in this paper, we hope to offer good reasons for thinking \\nthat it is. But that is not our main aim. Rather, we are interested in exploring how to \\nchoose a fairness measure within a context and thinking about when certain meas-\\nures should or should not be used. In the service of these goals, we will present \\na general picture for thinking about the choice of a fairness measure, discuss the \\nchoiceworthiness of three measures (‘fairness through unawareness’, ‘equalized \\nodds’, and ‘counterfactual fairness’), and draw from our discussion some general \\nlessons about measuring fairness.\\nA General Picture\\nTypically, discussions of fairness measures relate a few measures to one another and \\ndraw on cases in an attempt to show that the verdicts of the respective measures are \\nintuitively right or intuitively wrong. But these discussions rarely involve significant \\nengagement with the normative ideas—such as the specific egalitarian ideas—that \\nmight justify the choice of one measure over another. This, as we will soon demon-\\nstrate, leaves important tools for evaluating fairness measures on the table.4\\nTo this end, it will be helpful to sketch a general picture of the structure of the \\njustification of a measure. If a fairness measure is appropriate in some context (say, \\ncollege admissions), it is so because it tracks the verdicts of what we will call the \\nrelevant mid-level egalitarian principles that are implicated in that context. Which \\n(if any) mid-level egalitarian principles are implicated in a context is a function of \\nthe relevant facts about that context and the correct fundamental moral principle(s). \\nThe general picture, then, is this:\\n4 Heidari et\\xa0al. (2019) is a notable exception. Heidari et\\xa0al. argue that certain fairness measures can be \\ngiven a natural interpretation as operationalizing a concern for certain egalitarian principles, and that \\nusers of fairness measures have reason to select only a measure that reflects what, in the relevant context, \\nfairness requires. As will emerge in our discussion below, we fully agree. We take ourselves to building \\non this work (and that of Binns (2017)) by further investigating how robust are the justificatory connec-\\ntions between particular pairs of fairness measures and normative principles.\\n 240\\nC.\\xa0Castro et al.\\n1 3\\nSo, to provide an illustrative (if overly simplified) example: supposing the prin-\\nciple of utility is the correct fundamental moral principle, the mid-level egalitarian \\nprinciple ensure each person has equal chances at obtaining some good might be \\njustified in some context in virtue of the fact that satisfying that principle maximizes \\nutility in such contexts; and the use of a fairness measure in such contexts is, in turn, \\nappropriate if and only if it best (or sufficiently) approximates the verdicts of that \\nmid-level egalitarian principle.\\nThere are a few important observations that our general picture helps make clear.\\nFirst, it shows that disagreements over a fairness measure can have many sources \\nbeyond how a particular measure handles a particular case or how best to decide \\nbetween equally desirable but mutually unsatisfiable measures. A disagreement \\nover a fairness measure could be the result of a disagreement over what is the cor-\\nrect mid-level egalitarian principle, or it could result from an even deeper disagree-\\nment over which fundamental moral principles are the right ones. It could also stem \\nfrom a disagreement over empirical facts or over how to combine those facts with \\nthe fundamental moral principles. Or we could agree on all of this while still disa-\\ngreeing about which measure best approximates the relevant mid-level egalitarian \\nprinciple(s).\\nSecond—and relatedly—our picture shows that there are a number of normative \\ncriteria to evaluate fairness measures. A choice of a fairness measure could falter \\nin each of the ways that there is a possibility for disagreement. For instance, we \\nmight be correct in how to combine the correct fundamental moral principles with \\nthe empirical facts to identify the relevant mid-level egalitarian principle(s) for the \\ncontext, yet we may err in our selection of a measure, misidentifying the appropriate \\nmeasure for the task (relative to the egalitarian principle that we have identified). We \\ncan also, of course, make errors about which fundamental principles are the right \\nones, about how to combine them with the empirical facts, and so on.\\nThird, our picture makes clear that defenses and rejections of fairness measures \\ncan be extremely limited. Once we realize that a given measure is not just right or \\nwrong unconditionally, but, rather, is right or wrong given a particular context, we \\ncan see that a counterexample or defense of a measure might only apply within a \\nnarrow range of cases. In other words, showing that a given measure gets things \\nwrong in a particular case might not show that it is not a helpful measure in other \\ncases.\\nFinally, as alluded to above, our picture shows that we do not have to agree all \\nthe way down to agree on a measure. People with fundamental moral disagreements \\nmight still agree on the appropriateness of the use of a particular fairness meas-\\nure in some particular context. For instance, it is perfectly possible for a utilitarian \\nand a contractualist to agree that, within a certain context, we should satisfy a par-\\nticular mid-level egalitarian principle. Even though the contractualist and utilitarian \\nhave different reasons for endorsing that mid-level principle, they could converge \\non a specific egalitarian goal within a certain context and thus both be satisfied by a \\nmeasure that sufficiently tracks their shared egalitarian goal in that context.5\\n5 Cf. Rawls (1987, pp. 10-11) on the possibility that people with fundamental moral disagreements can \\nreach ‘overlapping consensus’ on principles to be used in a particular practical context. Cf. also Kagan \\n241\\n1 3\\nEgalitarian Machine Learning  \\nImportantly, we take this structure to be consistent with a wide range of norma-\\ntive theories, and, neither here nor in what follows, will we commit to any particular \\nfundamental or mid-level principles. Instead, we will utilize this structure to illumi-\\nnate different ways in which various fairness measures might succeed or fail. To this \\nend, we will next explore some of the space of different measures by considering \\nhow a few fairness measures fit—or fail to fit—with various mid-level egalitarian \\nprinciples. The ultimate purpose here is to make good on the claim that there are \\nindeed different measures that are desirable in different contexts, shed some light on \\nthe vast space of measures and egalitarian principles we might use, and show how \\nthinking about the egalitarian principles that motivate our choice of measure can \\nhelp us make at least some progress in selecting a measure appropriate for a particu-\\nlar context.\\nExploring the\\xa0Space of\\xa0Fairness Measures\\nWe will now explore the connections between various mid-level egalitarian princi-\\nples and context-specific fairness measures. In the case of each pairing, we take it \\nthat the measure will—at least in some contexts—be perfectly fine to use as part of a \\nregime for ensuring the kind of fairness under discussion. What we are interested in \\nexploring, then, are the robustness of the connections between different egalitarian \\nconceptions of fairness and particular measures of fairness. We will do this by ask-\\ning two questions about each principle/measure pair: Is satisfying the measure suf-\\nficient for satisfying the principle? Is satisfying the measure required for satisfying \\nthe principle? We will answer negatively in each case, showing that while a given \\nmeasure may be useful in some cases, none of the measures we discuss are generally \\nnecessary or sufficient for ensuring the sorts of fairness picked out by the mid-level \\negalitarian principles under discussion. This, we take it, is evidence for our claim \\nthat no existing fairness measure is context-invariant;6 rather, there is a plethora of \\nmeasures to choose from and choosing a measure for a context will take care and \\ngreat sensitivity to the normative and empirical details of that particular case. We \\nwill work from principles and measures that are less demanding to principles and \\nmeasures that are more demanding, using our counterexamples to motivate the more \\ndemanding principles and measures.\\nBefore embarking on that task, though, let us make two further important remarks \\nabout what we take success in our task to consist in.\\nThe first remark concerns the fairness measures that we will be considering. \\nThese measures are mathematical formulae. Our task would be uninterestingly \\neasy if, in order to show a mismatch between a formula and a mid-level egalitarian \\n6 Importantly, we will not argue for the impossibility of a context-invariant fairness measure. But here let \\nus register our skepticism that there could be one.\\n(1992) on the possibility that theories with different fundamental moral commitments can exhibit partial \\nagreement in their first-order principles.\\nFootnote 5 (continued)\\n 242\\nC.\\xa0Castro et al.\\n1 3\\nprinciple, we could simply stipulate a case in which someone made an obvious mis-\\ntake in the use of a formula (e.g., someone who uses a measure that disallows select-\\ning on the basis of some obviously unfair variables but does not take someone’s \\nrace, say, to be such a variable). Likewise, our task would be uninterestingly difficult \\nif, in order to show a mismatch, we had to demonstrate that, in some given case, it \\nwas impossible to substitute values for the relevant formula’s variables in a way that \\nmatched the verdicts of the relevant mid-level egalitarian principle. If the values of \\nthe formula’s variables could be chosen without restriction, on a case-by-case basis, \\nit would always be possible to find values that would force a ‘gerrymandered’ match \\nbetween the formula and any given egalitarian principle. To chart an interesting \\npath between these uninteresting alternatives, we propose to assume that the fair-\\nness measure in question is—roughly speaking—being used as intended. In other \\nwords, we assume a good-faith effort to hook up the measure’s variables to one’s \\ndata set on the basis of a fixed rule, given by the relevant egalitarian principle, to \\nbe used across multiple cases. That methodological assumption, we take it, ensures \\nthat any mismatches that we find are of practical interest. Under this assumption, a \\nmismatch would show that there is a non-superficial problem about using a given \\nfairness measure in the service of promoting a given egalitarian principle—it would \\nshow that the measure in question is not a foolproof way of operationalizing the rel-\\nevant egalitarian principle.\\nThe second remark concerns the egalitarian principles that we will be consider-\\ning. The literature contains a large number of formulations of each of these egali-\\ntarian principles. Thus there are, not only first-order normative disputes concerning \\nwhich of these principles best reflects a concern for fairness, but also first-order nor-\\nmative disputes intramurally among the adherents of each principle about the most \\nplausible or best-motivated formulation of the principle in question. In Sect.\\xa02, we \\nset aside the ambition to adjudicate first-order normative disputes among these prin-\\nciples. Likewise, our interest here is not in adjudicating this kind of intramural dis-\\npute. Instead, we propose to work with a generic or representative characterization \\nof each egalitarian principle and look for mismatches between the principle so con-\\nstrued and some particular fairness measure(s). Again, we make this methodological \\nmove in order to ensure that our results are of practical interest to users of fairness \\nmeasures. They show that there is at least a presumptive problem about drawing jus-\\ntificatory support for the use of a particular fairness measure, in some context, from \\na particular (family of) egalitarian principle(s).\\nFinally, we should note that, in keeping with the spirit of our methodology, we \\nhave tried to build our cases with sensitivity toward a further complication. The \\negalitarian principles that we will consider are competing accounts of when and why \\nthere is fairness simpliciter, in a given situation. But, arguably, some of the fairness \\nmeasures that we consider are designed to test for something narrower than whether \\nor not there is fairness simpliciter in a given situation. They are designed, rather, \\nto test for what might be called fairness in a narrow sense. A judge, for example, \\nmight decide fairly in this narrow sense if she bases her judgment only on the argu-\\nments offered by opposing counsel, even if background conditions mean that worse-\\noff defendants have access to worse-quality counsel. Here, there is something unfair \\nsimpliciter about the situation (in virtue of the background conditions), despite the \\n243\\n1 3\\nEgalitarian Machine Learning  \\njudge’s decision being narrowly fair. There are various ways in which this distinc-\\ntion—between fairness simpliciter and fairness in a narrower sense—might be made \\nprecise. Given our present purposes, however, we can leave this task aside. First, \\nwe have attempted to construct each of our cases in such a way that the fairness or \\nunfairness simpliciter is in part explained by some narrow sense in which the rel-\\nevant decision procedure (which the fairness measure is meant to evaluate) is fair \\nor unfair. This is just to say that we have attempted to construct our cases in such \\na way that this distinction will not cause trouble. Second, even if, upon reflection, \\nsome readers are unconvinced—insisting (for instance) that in some of our cases the \\nsituation described is unfair simpliciter but the relevant decision procedure’s use is \\nnevertheless fair in a narrower sense—our discussion should still be of some inter-\\nest insofar as it allows such readers to refine their judgments about which mid-level \\negalitarian principle best reflects the narrow sense of fairness that they take to apply \\nto the use of the relevant decision procedure.7\\nFormal Equality of\\xa0Opportunity and\\xa0Fairness Through Unawareness\\nWe will begin our exploration of the space by examining the relationship between \\none mid-level egalitarian principle, formal equality of opportunity, and a fairness \\nmeasure, fairness through unawareness.\\nFormal equality of opportunity requires that, ‘positions and posts that confer \\nsuperior advantages […] be open to all applicants. Applications are assessed on \\ntheir merits, and the applicant deemed most qualified according to appropriate cri-\\nteria is offered the position’ (Arneson, 2015). The ideal of formal equality of oppor-\\ntunity asks that characteristics not relevant to the position or post—such as (at least \\ntypically) one’s race or sex—do not bar applicants from consideration or figure into \\ndecisions.8 Rather, it asks that applicants are instead assessed on their merits alone.\\nFairness through unawareness asks that a prediction-based decision system not \\ntake as inputs protected attributes—i.e., features of a person that are not to be dis-\\ncriminated against (Grgic-Hlaca et\\xa0al. 2016; Kusner et\\xa0al. 2018). So, for example, if \\na bank is trying to decide to whom to lend by predicting who will make their pay-\\nments on time, fairness through unawareness asks that the bank not use data about \\nrace, sex, or ethnicity in issuing their predictions.\\nThat fairness through unawareness might be attractive from the perspective of \\nformal equality of opportunity—or, at least, that it might initially seem attractive—\\nshould be intuitive enough. After all, if we—as regulators—are asked to ensure that \\nbanks are satisfying formal equality of opportunity, it would seem reasonable to \\n7 Although our official position about narrower senses of fairness is, as we mentioned, an agnostic one, \\nin footnote 20 we briefly offer reason to doubt that, if there is fairness in a narrower sense, it is norma-\\ntively relevant in the cases that we discuss. We thank an anonymous reviewer for pushing us to consider \\nthis distinction.\\n8 Though, in some contexts, a protected attribute could very well be considered a merit. For instance, \\nHausman (2014) discusses a case in which race is a merit for a director searching for an actor to play the \\nrole of Martin Luther King. But, again, such cases are not typical.\\n 244\\nC.\\xa0Castro et al.\\n1 3\\ncheck that their predictive systems satisfy fairness through unawareness. A bank that \\nis filtering applicants for a loan by race seems to be selecting applicants based on \\na criterion not appropriate to the decision. If a bank fails to meet this low bar, that \\nwould seem at the very least to raise a red flag.9\\nBased on this gloss, it seems that fair equality of opportunity and fairness through \\nunawareness at least sometimes make sense as a pair. But now let us ask how robust \\nthat connection might be.\\nBegin with the question of sufficiency: Is satisfying fairness through unawareness \\ngenerally enough for satisfying formal equality of opportunity? We think that it is \\nfairly easy to see that it is not.\\nTo see why, consider the following case:\\nGraduate School The admissions system for a graduate program uses an \\nostensibly race-blind machine learning system to screen applicants. They now \\nreceive too many\\xa0applications to make the first cut by hand. Unbeknownst to \\nits users and creators, the system was trained on a data set that was heavily \\nbiased against a small minority group; further, membership in the group was \\nredundantly encoded in the data set and applications. As a result, certain mem-\\nbers of that group have their applications tossed out because the system can \\nidentify—and base predictions on—group membership, even though the sys-\\ntem is never explicitly told who belongs to which group.\\nIn this case, fairness through unawareness might be satisfied, so long as the sys-\\ntem uses the test score as an input but does not directly ask about race or ethnicity. \\nDespite satisfying fairness through unawareness, though, such a system would not \\nsatisfy formal equality of opportunity because the position is not (in the relevant \\nsense) open to all applicants: certain applicants fare no better than if they had not \\napplied, simply because of their race or ethnicity.\\nHaving seen that satisfying fairness through unawareness is not in general enough \\nfor satisfying formal equality of opportunity, we can turn to the question of whether \\nsatisfying fairness through unawareness is, in general, required for satisfying formal \\nequality of opportunity. To see that it is not, consider the following case:\\nJobs You are hiring. Job applicants take a free aptitude test. You know that \\nmembers of a minority suffer from a pronounced stereotype threat that reduces \\ntheir score on this test.10 (They are just as qualified for the position; the testing \\nenvironment just has this feature.) So when you assess applications, you take \\ntheir minority status into account by adjusting their scores.\\n9 Cp. Arneson (2015, p.5): ‘It should be noted that formal equality of opportunity […] puts moral con-\\nstraints on market decisions […] If one operates a business and provides a product or service to the pub-\\nlic for sale, formal equality of opportunity is violated if one refuses to sell to some class of potential \\ncustomers on grounds that are whimsical […] or prejudiced (Sect.\\xa01).’.\\n10 We should note here that we are not claiming that stereotype threat actually manifests this way. In this \\ncase, as in all other hypothetical cases in this paper, we are stipulating plausible—if oversimplified—\\ncausal claims strictly for illustrative purposes.\\n245\\n1 3\\nEgalitarian Machine Learning  \\nWe can imagine that in this case, you take minority status as an input for deciding \\nwho should get an adjustment. In such a case, fairness through unawareness is not \\nsatisfied (because the scores take a protected attribute as an input), and yet—so long \\nas the adjustment is appropriately calibrated—formal equality of opportunity very \\nplausibly is satisfied. Thus, fairness through unawareness is not in general required \\nfor satisfying formal equality of opportunity.11\\nImportantly, there is nothing especially odd or idiosyncratic about these cases. \\nAnd thus they show (or at least strongly suggest) that fairness through unawareness \\nand formal equality of opportunity can come apart in a significant range of cases. So \\nif fairness through unawareness is to be an appropriate measure of fairness in some \\ncontext in which formal equality of opportunity is the salient egalitarian principle, \\nwe need some reason to think that the context we are in is not one of those in which \\nthey come apart.\\nFormal Equality of\\xa0Opportunity and\\xa0Equalized Odds\\nHaving seen that fairness through unawareness is in general neither necessary nor \\nsufficient for formal equality of opportunity, let us consider one more fairness meas-\\nure as it relates to formal equality of opportunity: equalized odds. Equalized odds \\nasks that the rates of true positives and false positives are equal for each group \\n(demarcated by protected attributes). In symbols, equalized odds demands the fol-\\nlowing, where y stands for, ‘the subject has the property that the predictor is trying \\nto predict’, ̂y for, ‘the predictor predicts that the subject has the property’, and a for \\n‘the subject belongs to such-and-such protected class(es)’:\\nand\\nFormal equality of opportunity and equalized odds might seem to be an intuitive \\nfit because formal equality of opportunity wants us to consider all and consider them \\non their merits, and equalized odds asks that we not let protected attributes—which \\n(again) are not typically thought of as merits—affect our detection of merits.\\np(̂y|y&a) = p(̂y|y& ∼ a)\\np(̂y| ∼ y&a) = p(̂y| ∼ y& ∼ a)\\n11 Here, it is worth emphasizing that the practical force of this conclusion depends in part on whether \\nand to what extent something like the causal dependencies exhibited in our example manifest in the real \\nworld. At one extreme, they might represent mere conceptual possibilities and hence lack any practi-\\ncal upshot. This extreme, we reject. As mentioned in footnote\\xa010, we construct our examples to mimic \\nplausible real-world cases in which a fairness measure fails to track salient egalitarian concerns. That \\nsaid, exactly when and how often examples of the sort we discuss arise in the real world is an empirical \\nquestion that lies beyond the scope of this paper but whose answer—for precisely the reasons argued for \\nhere—is critically important for determining when and why any particular fairness measure should (or \\nshould not) be deployed in any particular circumstance.\\n 246\\nC.\\xa0Castro et al.\\n1 3\\nLet us now ask our familiar set of questions. Begin with the question of whether \\nsatisfying equalized odds is in general sufficient for satisfying formal equality of \\nopportunity. We can see that it is not by considering the following case:\\nGraduate School 2 The admissions system for a graduate program uses a \\nhighly but imperfectly accurate machine learning system to screen applicants. \\nWanting qualified applicants to have equal chances of success, they tell the \\nsystem to treat equalized odds as a constraint. In the population it scores, \\nhowever, members of a disadvantaged minority that values education highly \\nare much more likely to be qualified. To compensate for this while achiev-\\ning equality of opportunity, the system engages in a kind of leveling down: it \\nrejects certain likely-to-be-qualified applicants from that class, so as to keep \\ntrue and false positive rates in parity across groups.12\\nIn such a case, equalized odds is met by design. Yet, formal equality of opportu-\\nnity is not satisfied because the position is still not open to all—certain members are \\nrejected from consideration in virtue of belonging to a protected group.\\nHaving seen that satisfying equalized odds is not in general enough for satisfy-\\ning formal equality of opportunity, we can turn to the question of whether equal-\\nized odds is in general required for satisfying formal equality of opportunity. We can \\nagain show that it is not, this time by considering a variant of Jobs:\\nJobs 2 You are hiring. Job applicants take a highly—but not perfectly—accu-\\nrate, free aptitude test. Members of a disadvantaged minority group are much \\nmore likely to be qualified. This is because other employers discriminate \\nagainst this group, leaving a high proportion of qualified members of the group \\non the job market. As a result of the discrepancies in the base rates—where \\nmembers of the minority group are much more likely to be qualified—and the \\ntest’s being highly, but imperfectly, accurate, true positives are more common \\namong the minority group than in the majority group (i.e., it violates equalized \\nodds).\\nHere we have a case where formal equality of opportunity is met and yet equal-\\nized odds is not.\\nFormal equality of opportunity is met in this case because all applicants are being \\nconsidered and they are being considered on their merits. One might respond by \\nsaying that this could not be true in the case because the system is—in virtue of the \\nsame facts that constitute its violation of equalized odds—biased in favor of detect-\\ning qualifications in the minority group. In response, it is enough to note that formal \\nequality of opportunity is compatible with statistical discrimination, so long as the \\n12 This case might be a little confusing. How can we have an artificially high rejection rate for one group \\nwhile achieving equal true and false positive rates across groups? The key is that (a) the system is not \\nperfectly accurate (creating, in essence, some wiggle room), and (b) the uneven distribution of qualifica-\\ntions which, under certain conditions and in the absence of an artificially high rejection rate for the group \\nor some other corrective (such as perfect accuracy), will reveal itself in the form of asymmetrical true \\npositive or false positive rates. For a more fully fleshed out example of this phenomenon, see Sect.\\xa03.3. \\nFor a real-world instance of this phenomenon, see Corbett-Davies et\\xa0al. (2016).\\n247\\n1 3\\nEgalitarian Machine Learning  \\nstatistical discrimination makes use of the available information in a way that is rel-\\nevant to appropriate criteria, which it is in this case—the bias is a result of the test’s \\nhigh accuracy and the difference in base rates among applicants.13\\nInterlude: Formal Equality of\\xa0Opportunity, Fairness Through Unawareness, \\nand\\xa0Equalized Odds\\nSo far, we have shown that the verdicts of fairness through unawareness and equal-\\nized odds can come apart from those of formal equality of opportunity. But this is \\nconsistent with one measure or the other being in general the correct measure for \\nprediction-based decision making (in which case, so much the worse for formal \\nequality of opportunity). And it is also consistent with formal equality of opportu-\\nnity being in general the correct mid-level egalitarian principle to approximate for \\nprediction-based decision making (in which case, so much the worse for the afore-\\nmentioned measures). So before we move on to discussing other principles and \\nmeasures, it is worth pausing to consider whether any we have discussed so far are, \\nas a general matter, the correct principles or measures for prediction-based decision \\nmaking.\\nLet us begin by asking—independently of whether they coincide with formal \\nequality of opportunity—if the measures we have discussed seem to get things \\nright in the cases we have discussed so far. It seems that they do not. Each measure \\napproves of a graduate school system, and each system seems unfair to us (in the \\nsense of ‘unfair’ the measure is meant to track). Whatever the correct principle of \\nfairness is (in this context), it seems to be violated in that case. Thus, it is not true \\nthat, as a general matter, satisfying either of these measures is sufficient for being \\nfair.\\nWe can now turn to the question of whether satisfying either measure is neces-\\nsary for being fair. Again, we think not. Both measures condemn the systems in Jobs \\nand Jobs 2 and, yet, we do not think that the systems in those cases are unfair (in the \\ncontextually relevant sense).\\nNow, this claim might receive some pushback in the case of Jobs 2. Why don’t we \\nthink that the seeming bias against the majority group is an instance of unfairness? \\nLet us begin by filling in more details of the case. Suppose that the test—while vio-\\nlating equalized odds—satisfies a different fairness measure, calibration, which asks \\nthat, conditional on our predictions, ‘outcomes’ (our y variable) are probabilistically \\nindependent of protected attributes (Corbett-Davies and Goel 2018). In symbols, \\ncalibration asks that: 14, 15\\n14 As before, y stands for, ‘the subject has the property that the predictor is trying to predict’, ̂y for, ‘the \\npredictor predicts that the subject has the property’, and a for ‘the subject belongs to such and such pro-\\ntected class(es)’.\\n15 We do not have the space here to explore calibration the way we have explored fairness through una-\\nwareness and equalized odds, but we think that it—like those measures—is no panacea. To see why, we \\nrecommend Corbett-Davies and Goel (2018).\\n13 For further discussion of the compatibility of formal equality of opportunity and statistical discrimina-\\ntion, see Arneson (2015), Sect.\\xa01.3.\\n 248\\nC.\\xa0Castro et al.\\n1 3\\nand\\nNote that calibration seems to be as intuitive a measure of fairness as equalized \\nodds. But note that calibration and measures like equalized odds are, famously, both \\nseemingly attractive and in tension with one another (see Corbett-Davies and Goel \\n(2018) and Hedden (2021) for helpful overviews of these issues). We can see the \\ntension between the two measures by stipulating some numbers. Suppose the test \\nbehaves as follows:\\nPerformance among minority \\ngroup\\nActually qualified\\nActually not quali-\\nfied\\nShare correctly predicted\\nPredicted qualified\\n180\\n20\\n90% (of 200)\\nPredicted not qualified\\n10\\n90\\n90% (of 100)\\nPerformance among majority \\ngroup\\nActually qualified\\nActually not quali-\\nfied\\nShare correctly predicted\\nPredicted qualified\\n45\\n5\\n90% (of 50)\\nPredicted not qualified\\n10\\n90\\n90% (of 100)\\nThe reason these data are helpful is that they show that the test’s violation of \\nequalized odds—which we can now quantify: the probability of being identified \\nas qualified if you are a qualified member of the minority group is about 95%,16 \\nwhereas the probability of being identified as qualified if you are a qualified member \\nof the majority group is about 82%17—is born out of the fact that the test is both \\nhighly but not perfectly accurate and is testing groups with different base rates. The \\nfact that the test gets it right 90% of the time independently of which group one \\nbelongs to, in conjunction with the fact that the members of the minority group are \\nmuch more likely to be qualified (about 65% of the members of the minority group \\nare qualified whereas only about 35% of the members of the majority are), together \\nforce this result.\\nAll of this is a long-winded way of saying that the fact that the test in Jobs 2 is \\nmore likely to identify qualified minorities as qualified is not a matter of caprice; \\nrather, it is a result of being impartially accurate in a certain kind of way. Now, all of \\np(y|̂y&a) = p(y|̂y& ∼ a)\\np(y| ∼ ̂y&a) = p(y| ∼ ̂y& ∼ a)\\n16 Since p(̂y | a & y) = p(̂y & a & y) ÷ p(a & y) = (number of members of the minority group who are \\nqualified and test qualified ÷ total number of applicants) ÷ (total member of minority group who are quali-\\nfied ÷ total number of applicants) = (180 ÷ 450) ÷ (190 ÷ 450) = 180 ÷ 190 ≈ .95. (Where a = df. ‘is a mem-\\nber of the minority group’).\\n17 Since p(̂y |~ a & y) = p(̂y & ~ a & y) ÷ p(~ a & y) = (number of members of the majority group who \\nare qualified and test qualified ÷ total number of applicants) ÷ (total number of members of the majority \\ngroup who are qualified ÷ total number of applicants) = (45 ÷ 450) ÷ (55 ÷ 450) = 45 ÷ 55 ≈ .82.\\n249\\n1 3\\nEgalitarian Machine Learning  \\nthis is not enough to exculpate the test. To draw that conclusion too quickly would \\nbe to ignore one of the main lessons of this paper—i.e., that there are no hard and \\nfast rules for measuring machine fairness.18 Nevertheless, we think that the test in \\nJobs 2 is not unfair. Appreciating the fact that the test’s accuracy plus the difference \\nin base rates is what causes it to behave as it does helps make clear why.\\nThe further factors that we think make a difference here are as follows. To begin, \\nthere is the fact that the test is not compounding a noxious inequality but in fact \\nameliorating it. Similarly, the fact that the test ameliorates the inequality in a way \\nthat does not impose a cost on the worst off but instead by benefiting them also \\nseems relevant. These facts, in conjunction with the fact that the test is accurate and \\nobeys calibration, justify the deviation from equalized odds. Thus, satisfying equal-\\nized odds is not necessary for being, in the relevant sense, fair.\\nLet us now investigate formal equality of opportunity, which seems to get things \\nright in the cases so far discussed: Is it in general the principle of fairness that any \\nmeasure of fairness should approximate?19\\nUnsurprisingly, we think not. We can see this by considering another graduate \\nschool case. Let us start with the question of whether formal equality of opportunity \\nis sufficient for being fair. Consider the following:\\nGraduate School 3. The admissions system for a graduate program requires \\nscores of a difficult test, and members of disadvantaged minority groups, on \\naverage, do poorly on the test because they cannot afford the test preparation \\nneeded to be competitive.\\nIn this case, the prediction-based decision system is unfair. Yet formal equality of \\nopportunity does not seem to have been violated: no one is being denied the oppor-\\ntunity to apply in virtue of belonging to a protected group, and the system is—we \\ncan stipulate—tracking merits within a reasonable degree of accuracy (relative to \\nthe school’s one-dimensional goal of admitting the best prepared candidates). Thus, \\nwe do not think that formal equality of opportunity is, as a general matter, a correct \\nprinciple of fairness for prediction-based decision making.\\nFinally, we can ask whether formal equality of opportunity is required for being \\nfair. To see that it is not, we can consider a modified version of Jobs.\\nJobs 3. You are hiring. All are welcome to apply, but minorities are less likely \\nto be qualified due to educational inequities, and members of the privileged \\nmajority are more likely to be qualified but not due to hard work or persever-\\nance. As it happens, the job for which you are hiring is one for which some \\npreviously unqualified hires were able to learn on the job. So you devise a pre-\\n18 It is here worth noting that there are instances where we think pursuing calibration at the expense of \\nequalized odds is unfair. We think that the case that brought to light the tension between calibration and \\nmeasures like equalized odds—the notorious case of COMPAS (see Angwin et\\xa0al. 2016 for details)—is \\none of them.\\n19 Note that to the extent that the mid-level egalitarian principles are not—like the fairness measures—\\nnarrowly focused on a particular aspect of fairness, there is a larger stable of potential counterexamples \\nfrom which we might draw.\\n 250\\nC.\\xa0Castro et al.\\n1 3\\ndictive system for predicting which applicants will either arrive qualified or be \\nable to learn on the job. You then devise a lottery system to allocate positions \\namong them (so as not to perpetuate inequality).\\nOf course, the details here matter. But it seems to us that this system could be \\nfleshed out in a way that is fair. Still, formal equality of opportunity is not satisfied \\nbecause the system does not even attempt to select for the most qualified. Instead, it \\nselects for the sufficiently qualified, in the interest of fairness.20\\nSubstantive Equality of\\xa0Opportunity and\\xa0Counterfactual Fairness\\nIn Sects.\\xa03.1 and 3.2 we saw that fairness through unawareness and equalized odds \\ncan misfire in cases where the factors that a system treats as qualifications are influ-\\nenced by subjects’ protected attributes. Thus, in all of the graduate school cases, \\nmembership of the minority group is causally relevant to whether one is admitted; \\nfor some who are denied admission, they would have been admitted were they to \\nhave been members of the majority group. In Sect.\\xa03.3, we saw that formal equality \\nof opportunity misfires in similar cases. In Graduate School 3, formal equality of \\nopportunity is satisfied even though the system seems unfair because applicants do \\nnot have the same opportunity to develop the skills that the test is testing for.\\nAll this suggests that in certain cases being fair relies on sensitivity to certain \\nhistorical facts. The measures and principles we have considered so far are blind to \\nhistorical facts. Let us, then, consider a principle and a measure that is sensitive to \\nhistory.\\nConsider the egalitarian principle substantive equality of opportunity, which \\nprevails with respect to some desirable position or ranked order of positions \\njust in case all members of society are eligible to apply for the position, appli-\\ncations are fairly judged on their merits and the most meritorious are selected, \\nand sufficient opportunity to develop the qualifications needed for successful \\napplication is available to all (Arneson, 2015; emphasis ours).\\nIn asking that applicants have equal opportunity to develop qualifications needed \\nfor successful application, substantive equality of opportunity brings in a historical \\n20 Arguably, both Graduate School 3 and Jobs 3 raise the complication discussed at the end of Sect.\\xa03: \\nsomeone might judge that, although these situations are unfair simpliciter, the use of these prediction-\\nbased decision systems is nevertheless fair in a narrower sense (just as, e.g., judges do not act unfairly \\nin a narrow sense when they base their decisions on the arguments of opposing counsel). Since we are \\nusing these cases simply to motivate the interest of the more robust fairness measures and egalitarian \\nprinciples discussed in Sects.\\xa03.4 and 3.5, we officially wish to remain agnostic about this issue. But we \\nare doubtful that there is a compelling analogy here with the case of judges. Judges issue their decisions \\nfrom within a longstanding social practice that there is (we presume) good independent reason to struc-\\nture in the ways that the legal system is in fact structured. But the design, choice, and use of algorithms \\nin prediction-based decision making does not, offhand, appear to be embedded in any such social prac-\\ntice. So, even if the fact that some decisions are made fair in a narrow sense by conforming to certain \\nsocial practices, it is doubtful whether such grounds are available in the case of prediction-based decision \\nmaking.\\n251\\n1 3\\nEgalitarian Machine Learning  \\nelement. A formal equal opportunity principle takes the natural distribution of tal-\\nents or abilities as a given—i.e., beyond the purview of fairness—and is indiffer-\\nent to whether people can develop these talents. It requires only that, when people’s \\ntalents or abilities have been developed, careers be ‘equally open to (developed) tal-\\nents’. A substantive equal opportunity principle, on the other hand, though it takes \\nthe natural distribution of talents or abilities as a given, is not indifferent to whether \\npeople can develop these talents. It thus imposes significant further requirements on \\nwhat social institutions must do for people, over and above ensuring that careers are \\nopen to talents. It is, in this sense, ‘substantive’.21\\nApplied to Graduate School 3, substantive equality of opportunity seems to get \\nthe right result: applicants have not had the same opportunity to develop the skills \\nnecessary for successful application; thus, the test is unfair by the lights of this \\nprinciple.\\nNow consider the fairness measure counterfactual fairness. Counterfactual fair-\\nness says that a prediction-based decision system is fair if and only if each of its \\ndecisions is the same in the actual world as it is in any counterfactual world where \\nthe relevant individual belongs to a different demographic group. To see how coun-\\nterfactual fairness works, it will be helpful to consider another case:\\nLaw School Success.22 You are designing a prediction-based decision system \\nfor a law school’s admissions. What you want to predict is how well applicants \\nwill do in their first year. You choose this variable for two reasons. One is that, \\ngiven the law school’s student records, you can predict this with a high degree \\nof accuracy. The other is that first year grades are themselves highly predictive \\nof who will get a job coming out of law school. So, you decide that you will \\nadmit only those predicted to get good scores their first year. We can imagine \\nthat the system bases its predictions on two inputs: one’s undergraduate GPA \\n(grade point average) and LSAT (Law School Admission Test) score.\\nNow let us ask: is such a system counterfactually fair?\\nTo answer this question, we need to answer a few others. We will first ask what \\nscore the system gives a particular individual; we will then need to ask whether \\nthey would have received a different score were they to have belonged to a different \\ndemographic group.\\nTo do this, let us consider a case. Suppose Jones applies to the school. He applies \\nwith an undergraduate GPA of 3.5 and LSAT score of 150. The system finds that \\napplicants with those scores will get a first year average of 3.8, which it considers \\n‘good’—the cut-off is 3.7. Now let us turn to the more nebulous question of whether \\nJones would have gotten a different score were he to have had different protected \\nattributes.\\nTo answer this, we need two things: information about Jones’s protected attrib-\\nutes and a causal model—a way of describing how certain features of the world \\n21 Later, in Sect.\\xa03.5, we consider an even more demanding egalitarian principle that does not take the \\nnatural distribution of talents or abilities as a given.\\n22 This case and the causal model depicting it are adapted from Kusner et\\xa0al. (2018).\\n 252\\nC.\\xa0Castro et al.\\n1 3\\ncausally interact with each other.23 We’ll stipulate that Jones is a White male and \\nthat the causal scenario is summarized by the following model, where items in boxes \\ndepict variables and the arrows connecting the boxes depict causal relations (such \\nthat an arrow pointing from one variable to another indicates that the former vari-\\nable is a cause of the latter):24\\nWith the information about Jones’s protected attributes and our causal model, we \\nare in position to ask and answer questions such as ‘Would Jones have been admitted \\nwere he Black and female?’\\nFirst, we use our causal knowledge and known variables to solve for an unknown \\nvariable: studiousness. To keep things simple, we will stipulate the following result: \\nJones has an average level of studiousness, a 7 on a scale of 10.\\nSecond, we reassign Jones’s protected attributes in our model and use our causal \\nknowledge in conjunction with our newfound knowledge of Jones’s level of studi-\\nousness to determine what Jones’s GPA, LSAT score, and (predicted) first year law \\ngrades would have been in the counterfactual scenario under consideration. Let us \\nstipulate that the resulting graph summarizes our findings:\\n23 For an accessible primer on causal models, see Pearl et\\xa0al. (2016).\\n24 Note: it is plausible that there are arrows running from race and sex to GPA, LSAT score, and first \\nyear law grades since race and sex influence these factors via racism and sexism (via, e.g., differences in \\nclass size across schools students are coming from, teachers stereotyping students as more or less likely \\nto succeed or more or less likely to have behavioral problems, and so on). But of course it is not plausible \\nthat race and sex are the only influences on these things; hence we use ‘studiousness’ as a catch-all to \\nrepresent the bundle of intrinsic attributes not causally related to one’s race or sex that influence GPA, \\nLSAT score, and first year law grades. Note also (as previewed in footnote 10) that this is a massively \\noversimplified model that is being used for illustrative purposes; in reality, there are many more variables \\nthan those represented above, and the variables we have chosen might not actually interact exactly in the \\nway pictured here.\\n253\\n1 3\\nEgalitarian Machine Learning  \\nNote that in this counterfactual scenario—where Jones is Black and female—\\nJones is not admitted to the law school (recall that the cut-off for first year law \\ngrades is 3.7). For this reason, the system in Law School Success is not counter-\\nfactually fair.\\nThis might lead us to wonder what—if anything—is a counterfactually fair \\nway to handle this scenario. The answer is that admitting students on the basis \\nof studiousness—which, in our causal model, is not affected by one’s protected \\nattributes—will yield counterfactually fair results. This is precisely because—in \\nthe hypothetical world that our model represents—studiousness is not affected by \\nrace. Put another way, toggling one’s race or sex will never—on this model—tog-\\ngle their studiousness, so decisions based on studiousness will always pass the \\ntest of being counterfactually fair.\\nBefore we turn to our usual set of questions about this measure/principle pair, \\nlet us note why one might think that counterfactual fairness and substantive \\nequality of opportunity might make for a good match (in at least some cases). \\nCounterfactual fairness instructs us to base our prediction-based decisions on \\nvariables unaffected by membership in protected classes. In many cases, this is a \\nway to turn away from ‘developed merits’ that applicants may not have had simi-\\nlar chances to develop and toward variables that applicants will have had similar \\nchances to develop. While—as we will soon demonstrate—the counterfactually \\nfair thing to do will not always be the fair thing to do by the lights of substantive \\nequality of opportunity, there is clearly much to be said for counterfactual fair-\\nness’s ability to encode substantive equality of opportunity’s concerns in particu-\\nlar circumstances.\\nWith this in mind, let us turn to our questions. We will begin with the question \\nof whether satisfying counterfactual fairness is sufficient for satisfying substan-\\ntive equality of opportunity, and we will start by scrutinizing the model used in \\nLaw School Success.\\nIn our model, neither race nor sex affect studiousness. In the real world, how-\\never, it is quite plausible that race or sex affect studiousness. After all, the same \\n 254\\nC.\\xa0Castro et al.\\n1 3\\nracist or sexist factors that affect one’s GPA are likely to affect their studiousness. \\nSuppose, for instance, that race indirectly affects studiousness in the following \\nmanner. One’s race affects their wages, which causes stress that affects their abil-\\nity to study. So, studiousness is—in the real world—affected by race. So, in a \\nreal-world analog of Law School Success, selecting on the basis of studiousness \\nwould not be counterfactually fair.\\nOne might think, however, that in any real-life analog of Law School Success it \\nwould always be possible to identify a studiousness-like variable that is not affected \\nby race—and, therefore, always be possible to use the counterfactual fairness meas-\\nure in a way that is sufficient to satisfy substantive equality of opportunity. We have \\ntwo replies. First, even if it is always possible to identify a variable that satisfies \\ncounterfactual fairness in this way, there is no guarantee that substantive equality of \\nopportunity would favor selecting on the basis of that variable. Recall that substan-\\ntive equality of opportunity requires that equally meritorious applicants have simi-\\nlar prospects, irrespective of social circumstances like race or sex. The fact that a \\ncounterfactually fair variable is uncorrelated with race or sex does not entail that it \\nis relevant to applicants’ meritoriousness. Second, even when it is possible to find a \\ncounterfactually fair variable that is, by the lights of substantive equality of opportu-\\nnity, appropriate to select for, satisfying counterfactual fairness is still not sufficient \\nfor satisfying substantive equality of opportunity. To see this, consider another case:\\nLaw School Success 2. Seeing that race affects grades and LSAT scores, and \\nvaluing counterfactual fairness, the admissions team seeks to base entry on a \\ndifferent variable. As it turns out, applicants come from two different, perfectly \\nintegrated local colleges. One happened to begin offering pre-law courses after \\nstudents in the cohort matriculated, whereas the other did not. The admissions \\nteam uses the pre-law course as a determining factor in their admissions deci-\\nsions, reasoning that anyone who passed their pre-law courses would excel in \\nlaw school.\\nThis case shows that there are some deep problems with at least some applica-\\ntions of counterfactual fairness, at least from the perspective of substantive equality \\nof opportunity. After all, if part of the motivation for turning to substantive equality \\nof opportunity was that we thought that it is unfair to judge applicants on attributes \\nthey had unequal opportunities to develop, then, in at least some cases—in particu-\\nlar, those in which unequal opportunities do not correlate with demographic group \\nmembership—counterfactual fairness is liable to make us unhappy. Suffice to say, \\nsatisfying counterfactual fairness is not enough for satisfying substantive equality of \\nopportunity.\\nLet us, then, turn to the question of whether satisfying counterfactual fairness is \\nrequired for satisfying substantive equality of opportunity. To see that it is not, con-\\nsider another case:\\nInternship. You are hiring for an internship that requires English/Spanish flu-\\nency. All students had to take a language class, but only some took Spanish \\n(even though all had the opportunity). Among the cohort, there are many His-\\npanic students who speak Spanish at home, and thus are fluent whether or not \\n255\\n1 3\\nEgalitarian Machine Learning  \\nthey took the class. You have applicants take a Spanish exam as part of their \\napplication.\\nAssume that the causal graph for this case looks like this:\\nSuppose, for simplicity, that taking the Spanish course guarantees that you will \\nscore highly enough on the exam to be considered fluent. In such a case, taking the \\nSpanish score as an input runs afoul of counterfactual fairness because one’s score \\non the exam is causally downstream of one’s ethnicity—if a Hispanic student who \\ndid not take the course were to have been non-Hispanic, it is possible that that stu-\\ndent would not have scored highly enough to be considered fluent. Yet, this is not \\nproblematic from the point of view of substantive equality of opportunity, since all \\napplicants had the opportunity to develop Spanish fluency. Thus, satisfying counter-\\nfactual fairness is not necessary for satisfying substantive equality of opportunity.\\nLuck Egalitarianism and\\xa0Counterfactual Fairness\\nSubstantive equality of opportunity is a demanding egalitarian ideal. But it is con-\\nsistent with deep social inequalities that are the result of people having different pro-\\nfiles of ‘natural’ talents and abilities.25 Some have therefore proposed a principle \\nthat generalizes the considerations that motivate substantive equality of opportunity. \\nThis even more demanding luck egalitarian principle takes there to be unfairness, \\nnot only when people’s unchosen social backgrounds influence how well their lives \\ngo, but when any unchosen factors result in lives going unequally well.26 Luck egali-\\ntarianism, then, is the view that it is unfair for some to be worse off than others \\nthrough no choice of their own.27\\n25 Cp. Arneson (2015: Sect.\\xa01); Cohen (2008, pp. 2-3); Segall (2014, pp. 6–7)\\n26 Cp. Cohen (2009, pp. 17-18).\\n27 Cp. Temkin (1993, p. 17); Cohen (2008, p. 7).\\n 256\\nC.\\xa0Castro et al.\\n1 3\\nThis preliminary formulation of the view—in particular the ‘through no choice of \\ntheir own’ clause—requires further precisification in at least two ways. The first way, \\nwell known to the literature, concerns the interpretation of ‘choice’. Someone might \\nbecome worse off than others in either of two ways. She might be made worse off \\nby some event entirely unrelated to her choices; in the literature’s jargon, she might \\nbe the victim of bad brute luck (which is ‘a matter of how risks fall out that are not \\n[…] deliberate gambles’(Dworkin, 2001, p. 73)). Or she might be made worse off \\nby some event that is the unlucky result of an avoidable, risky choice that she made; \\nshe might be the victim of bad option luck (which is ‘a matter of how deliberate and \\ncalculated gambles turn out—whether someone gains or loses through accepting an \\nisolated risk he or she should have anticipated and might have declined’ (Dworkin, \\n2001, p. 73)). Importantly, ‘through no choice of their own’ is to be interpreted as \\ncondemning only inequalities that reflect bad brute luck; luck egalitarianism need \\nnot, implausibly, require compensating those who take avoidable gambles and lose \\nout. The second way in which ‘through no choice of their own’ requires precisifica-\\ntion, less well known to the literature, concerns the interpretation of ‘through’. This \\nmight be given either a causal reading or a non-causal reading. We return to this \\nmatter below, after introducing a case that illustrates the issue.\\nUnlike formal equality of opportunity (and, in some contexts, substantive equal-\\nity of opportunity),28 luck egalitarianism is not a legally codified standard. But luck \\negalitarianism has been claimed to be an attractive and plausible principle of fair-\\nness in a variety of practical contexts.29 So, insofar as some users of fairness meas-\\nures aim to do what, in the relevant context, is fairest, it is worth asking whether any \\nmeasures of machine fairness reliably track the luck egalitarian view of fairness.\\nCounterfactual fairness once again seems an obvious fit. We have already seen \\nhow counterfactual fairness seems to reflect the considerations that motivate one \\ndemanding equal-opportunity principle, substantive equality of opportunity. Thus \\none might reasonably expect that, by choosing an expanded set of protected attrib-\\nutes—including all those attributes of a person for which it would not be reasonable \\nto hold that person responsible—the counterfactual fairness measure might be used \\nto operationalize luck egalitarianism.30\\nWe have already seen, however, reasons to think that satisfying counterfac-\\ntual fairness is neither necessary nor sufficient for satisfying luck egalitarian-\\nism. As noted above, luck egalitarianism is in effect a robust equal-opportunity \\n28 See Brighouse et\\xa0al. (forthcoming) for discussion, in the case of education, of how substantive equal-\\nity of opportunity informs the law and other educational standards.\\n29 For example, luck egalitarianism has been defended as a plausible approach to ethical questions in \\nhealthcare policy (Segall (2009) and Eyal (2013)); education policy (Voigt (2007) and Harel Ben-Shahar \\n(2016)); and social policy (Dworkin (2001) and Segall (2012)).\\n30 Indeed, in motivating counterfactual fairness, Kusner et\\xa0 al. (2018, p. 7) emphasize this affinity \\nbetween the measure and the motivations for luck egalitarianism. This apparent motivation for the meas-\\nure, we take it, is all the more reason to ask how tight is the connection between the measure and the \\nconsiderations that seem to motivate it. Noteworthy also, as Kusner et\\xa0al. (2018, p. 3) emphasize, is the \\ncounterfactual fairness measure’s commitment to facts about individuals, not groups, as the determinant \\nof whether there is unfairness; this is a commitment shared by canonical versions of luck egalitarianism \\n(cp. Temkin (1993, p. 92)).\\n257\\n1 3\\nEgalitarian Machine Learning  \\nprinciple—requiring that how people fare relative to each other be insensitive, not \\nonly to unchosen social circumstances, but also to unchosen natural circumstances. \\nAnd we have already seen, via the Law School Success 2 and Internship cases, that \\nsatisfying counterfactual fairness is neither necessary nor sufficient for satisfying \\nsuch an equal-opportunity principle. Law School Success 2 and Internship already \\nshow, then, that satisfying counterfactual fairness is neither necessary nor suffi-\\ncient for satisfying luck egalitarianism’s requirements. However, it is possible to say \\nmore, and we think it is worth doing so. As we show in the remainder of this sec-\\ntion, given the distinctive motivations for luck egalitarianism, there are some fur-\\nther kinds of mismatch between counterfactual fairness and luck egalitarianism, over \\nand above the kinds of mismatch between counterfactual fairness and substantive \\nequality of opportunity discussed above. Since this provides further support for our \\ncentral thesis—namely, that there is no extant fairness measure that can be used in a \\ncontext-invariant way to operationalize the concerns expressed by a given mid-level \\negalitarian principle—we focus in this section on showing that there is a distinctive \\nsource or kind of mismatch between counterfactual fairness and luck egalitarianism.\\nTo see, then, a (distinctive) reason to doubt that satisfying counterfactual fairness \\nis sufficient for satisfying luck egalitarianism, consider a somewhat stylized case:\\nInsurance. A bank offers no-questions-asked loan insurance to businesses. To \\ndecide whom to approve, they use an algorithm that is based on a sophisti-\\ncated, proprietary prediction of the quality of applicants’ future business deci-\\nsions. Frank and Rita have neighboring businesses, both inherited, and neither \\nhas any other feasible way of making a living. They both apply for insurance. \\nFrank has a history of foolhardy business decisions, but as it happens (and as \\nthe algorithm correctly predicts) will not soon make another one. Rita has a \\nhistory of responsible business decisions, but as it happens (and as the algo-\\nrithm correctly predicts) will soon make an uncharacteristically foolhardy one.\\nThe bank thus denies Rita’s application and approves Frank’s. The algorithm on \\nwhich they base their decision satisfies counterfactual fairness. It treats people dif-\\nferently only when a factor for which it is reasonable to hold them responsible—\\nthe predicted quality of their business decisions—differs. Suppose next that Frank \\nand Rita both default on loans. In Rita’s case, this is because of the uncharacteristi-\\ncally foolhardy business decision. But in Frank’s case this is because his business \\nis struck by a meteorite, one which could easily have struck Rita’s business instead. \\nThe bank’s actions then leave Rita worse off (her application having been denied) \\nand Frank better off (his application having been approved). But on an orthodox \\ninterpretation of luck egalitarianism, we will next argue, this inequality is unfair. \\nAnd if so, then satisfying counterfactual fairness is not sufficient for satisfying luck \\negalitarianism.\\nFirst, we need to explain why we take it that according to orthodox versions of \\nthe luck egalitarian view, the inequality between Frank and Rita is unfair. To see the \\nmotivation for this claim, consider a hypothetical case that does not involve predic-\\ntion-based decision making. Two people are badly off, and you can benefit one of \\nthem. One of these people is responsible Rick, who is badly off only because of an \\nunpredictable lightning strike. The other badly off person is foolhardy Fionnuala. \\n 258\\nC.\\xa0Castro et al.\\n1 3\\nFionnuala is badly off as a result of having faced ten identical choices. Each time, \\nshe was asked to choose between option 1 (a 99% chance of serious harm and a 1% \\nchance of a moderate benefit) and option 2 (a 99% chance of a trivial benefit and \\na 1% chance of serious harm). She foolhardily chooses option 1 rather than option \\n2 the first nine times she faces this choice, and then sensibly chooses option 2 the \\ntenth time. And Fionnuala ends up suffering the serious harm as a result of one of \\nthese ten choices.\\nNow consider two variants of this case: in one, Fionnuala suffers the harm as \\na result of her ninth choice (i.e., the last time she chooses option 1), whereas in \\ntwo, Fionnuala suffers the harm as a result of her tenth choice (i.e., the only time \\nshe chooses option 2). Orthodox luck egalitarianism is indifferent between variants \\none and two of this case. In neither case does it take there to be a reason of fair-\\nness to benefit Fionnuala rather than Rick. Relative to the conception of fairness that \\nanimates the view, the ‘local’ facts—i.e., whether some particular welfare-reducing \\nevent also happens to line up with one’s being responsible for that particular event’s \\noccurrence—are immaterial. To impose this condition would be to impose a ‘weird \\ncausal requirement’,31 one unmotivated by the concerns that animate luck egalitari-\\nanism. It is enough, for an inequality to raise luck-egalitarian concern, that it fails \\nto reflect people’s ‘global’ responsibility profiles. This luck-egalitarian orthodoxy \\nseems to us internally well motivated. Given that Fionnuala makes the very same \\nset of choices in each of the two variant cases, it would be odd to think that it should \\nmatter greatly, from the point of view of fairness, whether or not her suffering hap-\\npens to be causally hooked up to her tenth rather than her ninth choice. After all, \\nwhether it is the ninth or tenth choice that triggers the harm to her is not something \\nwithin her control. So a version of luck egalitarianism that issued differing verdicts \\nabout these two variants of the case would entail that whether an inequality is unfair \\nor not depends on a kind of brute luck. But this sits ill with the standard motivations \\nfor luck egalitarianism that we discussed above, which take this kind of luck not to \\nhave justifying force.\\nNow the crucial point that we wish to make here is that the case of Rick and \\nFionnuala is relevantly similar to the Insurance case. Just as in the case of Rick and \\nFionnuala, in the Insurance case Rita’s being worse off than Frank misaligns with \\nRita’s and Frank’s respective ‘global’ responsibility profiles. And just as in the case \\nof Rick and Fionnuala, it is ‘global’ responsibility profiles that are, by orthodox \\nluck-egalitarian lights, the morally relevant factor when assessing inequalities. And \\nhence, just as in the case of Rick and Fionnuala, in the Insurance case too Rita’s \\nbeing worse off than Frank would be condemned by orthodox luck egalitarianism.32\\n31 Cp. Arneson and Hurley (2001, p. 85).\\n32 To our knowledge, the only dissent from this luck-egalitarian orthodoxy is to be found in Segall \\n(2014, pp. 49-50). (Temkin (2011, pp. 65-66) defends a pluralist view, close enough to the orthodoxy \\nfor our purposes, on which ‘global’ considerations of fairness matter in their own right over and above \\n‘local’ ones.) Segall, however, does not intend his discussion to refute the orthodoxy but rather to offer \\nan attractive alternative to it (Segall (2014, p. 43)). So, for our purposes, this intramural luck-egalitarian \\ndispute can be set aside. The point is that there is a well-motivated luck-egalitarian principle which con-\\ndemns the inequality in question. The further question of whether, all things considered, this principle \\n259\\n1 3\\nEgalitarian Machine Learning  \\nHaving explained the attitude that luck egalitarianism takes toward the inequality \\nin this case, let us now turn to explain why we take it that counterfactual fairness is \\nsatisfied in this Insurance case. In making its decision, this firm treats only factors \\nbeyond someone’s control, and not their responsible choices, as protected attributes; \\nso, by the lights of counterfactual fairness, the firm has not acted unfairly. Now, we \\nhave stipulated a version of the case in which Frank and Rita are first-time custom-\\ners of the bank. In other versions of the case, of course, using counterfactual fairness \\nneed not come apart from luck egalitarianism. If Frank and Rita had been long-time \\ncustomers, for example, then by appropriately selecting variables, the bank could \\nhave ensured that ‘global’ responsibility considerations drove their decisions about \\nthe applications.33 To see the interest of our result, recall our aim. As we explained \\nin Sect.\\xa03, we are investigating the possibility of mismatches even when the user of \\na fairness measure ‘hooks up the measure’s variables to one’s data set on the basis \\nof a fixed rule, given by the relevant egalitarian principle, to be used across multiple \\ncases’. The Insurance case fits that bill. Indeed, it is hard to see how, in ordinary \\ncircumstances, a firm could use the counterfactual fairness measure other than by \\nfollowing such a rule. What the Insurance case shows is that mechanically following \\nsuch a rule—even one that, over time, could be kosher by luck-egalitarian lights—\\nis not always enough. Our point, then—here as in earlier sections—is not that the \\ncounterfactual fairness measure is a fundamentally flawed way of operationalizing \\nthis mid-level egalitarian principle. Our point, rather, is that users of this measure \\nneed to be aware of the possibility of cases that are relevantly similar to our stylized \\none. If users of the measure are in such circumstances, then the relevant mid-level \\negalitarian principle would not—as it in other circumstances might—justify using \\nthe measure.\\nLet us now continue on to show that satisfying counterfactual fairness is not nec-\\nessary for satisfying luck egalitarianism. As noted above, we could here return to \\nthe Internship case from Sect.\\xa03.4. Recall that,\\xa0there, a score on a Spanish-language \\ntest was used to decide whom to hire. Now consider the inequality between someone \\nof Hispanic background who is selected for the internship on this basis and some-\\none from a non-Hispanic background who is not. By luck-egalitarian lights, there is \\nis the most plausible version of luck egalitarianism (considered either as an unconditional or mid-level \\negalitarian principle) is a substantive first-order question of the kind we are setting aside.\\nFootnote 32 (continued)\\n33 There are of course other cases that resemble the Insurance case in which counterfactual fairness \\nwould not come apart from luck egalitarianism—for example, cases in which it is a matter of option luck \\nwhether these business-owners were in the situation in which they are exposed to these risks of harm in \\nthe first place. We have stipulated away this possibility in the Insurance case, by placing Frank and Rita \\nin\\xa0situations to which they have no reasonable alternative option but to run their respective inherited \\nbusinesses, and by stipulating that the inequality is in part the result of a kind of force majeure—namely, \\na meteorite strike—that could not plausibly be claimed to be an instance of option luck. These details of \\nthe case, although somewhat fanciful, illustrate vividly the kinds of cases in which this kind of mismatch \\ncould arise: one-off interactions between the algorithm and those subject to it, with a great deal at stake, \\nagainst a background for which no one can reasonably be held responsible, and in which the algorithm \\ntracks ‘local’ responsibility facts. We think this is a plausible causal possibility, but as we noted in foot-\\nnote\\xa011, we take no stand on the empirical question of how often such cases in fact arise. (We thank an \\nanonymous reviewer for helpful comments on this point.)\\n 260\\nC.\\xa0Castro et al.\\n1 3\\nno unfairness here, given that the choice not to take the class is one for which the \\nlatter person could reasonably be held responsible. Thus, although using the test is \\nnot counterfactually fair, it is unobjectionable by luck-egalitarian lights. But, again, \\nthere are two further distinctive reasons, worth separate mention, to think that sat-\\nisfying counterfactual fairness is not necessary for satisfying luck egalitarianism. \\nThey each illustrate different ways in which, in some cases, to ‘mechanically’ read \\noff verdicts about fairness from the causal facts would be to overlook considerations \\nto which luck egalitarianism is sensitive.\\nConsider first another artificially simple case:\\nDrug. Two doses of a scarce drug are to be distributed among two patients, \\nAlice and Bob, who are not responsible for their health conditions. The hospi-\\ntal makes the decision on the basis of an algorithm that predicts which distri-\\nbution of doses would deliver the greatest aggregate health benefit. As it hap-\\npens, that’s giving one dose to each, which would restore each to the same \\nintermediate level of health.\\nUsing the algorithm in Drug would not satisfy counterfactual fairness: how much \\neach of these persons stands to benefit from some health intervention is not an \\nattribute for which it is reasonable to hold either responsible. For example, had the \\nbenefit of giving Bob both doses been greater than the aggregate benefit of giving \\nAlice and Bob each one dose, the algorithm would recommend that Bob get both \\ndoses, and clearly this would be unfair by luck-egalitarian lights. But luck egalitari-\\nanism is satisfied in this case, for the trivial reason that the algorithm’s use, in this \\ncontext, renders people equally well off. And, according to an influential version of \\nluck egalitarianism, the view only ever condemns (some) welfare inequalities but \\nnever welfare equalities. (Indeed, luck egalitarians arguably must endorse an ‘asym-\\nmetrical’ view of this kind if they are to preserve the credentials of their view as a \\ngenuinely egalitarian one—and not one a view that simply reduces to a disguised \\nconcern that people should enjoy a level of wellbeing that reflects their responsible \\nchoices.34) So satisfying counterfactual fairness is not necessary for satisfying luck \\negalitarianism. What the Drug case shows, in other words, is that the luck egalitar-\\nian need not always have an objection to the use of an algorithm that is not counter-\\nfactually fair—even if, as in this case, the algorithm favors an end such as welfare \\nmaximization that generally conflicts with luck egalitarian requirements.\\nEven if one sets aside such ‘asymmetrical’ versions of luck egalitarianism, satis-\\nfying counterfactual fairness would not be necessary for satisfying luck egalitarian-\\nism. For a counterexample of the same kind with a different source, we can return to \\na variant of our earlier Insurance case:\\n34 For discussion of these issues and defense of this ‘asymmetrical’ version of luck egalitarianism (so-\\ncalled because it treats asymmetrically inequalities and equalities that arise from factors beyond people’s \\ncontrol), see Segall (2016, chapter\\xa03). As before, we are not taking a stance on the first-order normative \\nintramural debate among luck egalitarians; the present point is that this ‘asymmetrical’ version of luck \\negalitarianism is a well-motivated version of the view.\\n261\\n1 3\\nEgalitarian Machine Learning  \\nInsurance 2. The background circumstances are all as in the original Insur-\\nance case, except the following. The bank that offers no-questions-asked loan \\ninsurance to businesses uses an algorithm that is based on a sophisticated, pro-\\nprietary prediction of catastrophic events in very localized areas. The predic-\\ntion engine determines that Frank’s business, but not Rita’s, is likely to suffer a \\ncatastrophic event. And as before whereas foolhardy Frank often makes foolish \\nbusiness decisions, responsible Rita rarely does.\\nSuppose that, as it happens, again Frank defaults on a loan because his business is \\nstruck by a meteorite that could easily have struck Rita’s business, and Rita defaults \\non a loan because of an uncharacteristically foolhardy business decision. The bank’s \\nactions would leave Rita better off (since her application would have been approved) \\nand Frank worse off (since his application would have been denied). But, for the rea-\\nsons explained earlier in this section, orthodox luck egalitarianism would not judge \\nthis inequality to be unfair. (In this variant of the case, the inequality between Frank \\nand Rita aligns with their ‘global’ profiles of (ir)responsibility.) So, although the \\nalgorithm does not satisfy counterfactual fairness (since it would have treated Frank \\ndifferently, had a factor for which it is not reasonable to hold him responsible—\\nnamely, whether his business was afflicted by the catastrophic event—differed), its \\nuse here would not be objectionable by luck-egalitarian lights.\\nThe stylized cases discussed in this section are, of course, somewhat unusual. \\nWe do not discuss them because we think it especially likely that users of counter-\\nfactually fair prediction-based decision procedures would often face such scenarios. \\nRather, we discuss them because they illustrate in a particularly vivid way a general \\ntheme that emerges from our discussion of counterfactual fairness. Counterfactual \\nfairness reads off, from inspection of a prediction-based decision procedure in light \\nof the (assumed) causal facts, the presence of fairness or unfairness. But our dis-\\ncussion shows that both substantive equality of opportunity and luck egalitarianism \\nare, in various ways, sensitive to information other than that contained in the (mere) \\ncausal facts. That is why counterfactual fairness is not a foolproof guide to fairness, \\nconstrued luck-egalitarian-wise.\\nSome Lessons\\nHaving completed our tour of an admittedly small fraction of the vast space of fair-\\nness measures, let us step back and draw some lessons from what we have done.\\nOne lesson is that choosing proper measures requires nuance and great sensitivity \\nto the egalitarian principles that undergird our choice of measure. This lesson has \\nimportant applications going forward. Consider counterfactual fairness. Clarifying \\none’s egalitarian motives for pursuing counterfactual fairness might help answer an \\nimportant question about any pursuit of counterfactual fairness. As the progenitors \\nof counterfactual fairness are keen to note, pursuing counterfactual fairness often \\ncomes at a price: loss of accuracy. This loss of accuracy raises a moral concern: \\n 262\\nC.\\xa0Castro et al.\\n1 3\\nHow are we to think about trade-offs between fairness and accuracy?35 While we \\nwill not purport to answer this question as a general matter, we do think that our \\napproach offers some guidance. Recall Law School Success 2. Imagine that in using \\nthe pre-law course as a variable, we hardly lose any accuracy at all; that is, pass-\\ning the course turns out to be highly predictive of law school success. Suppose the \\nadmissions committee nevertheless asks whether the loss of accuracy in moving \\nfrom the even more predictive (but counterfactually unfair) studiousness variable \\nis morally acceptable. Our approach gives the admissions committee guidance. We \\ncould tell the committee to focus less on how much accuracy they are losing and to \\nfocus more on why they are losing accuracy and what the proper egalitarian goal \\nhas to say about it. If the proper principle for the occasion is substantive equality \\nof opportunity, then the counterfactually fair system that uses the pre-law course \\nvariable will not be satisfactory and the committee should look for some other way \\nof designing their system, because substantive equality of opportunity condemns its \\nuse. The more general lesson here is that if we bring to bear the egalitarian prin-\\nciples that are driving our choice of fairness measures in the first place, nebulous \\nquestions about trade-offs between accuracy and fairness can become better defined \\nquestions of whether the systems associated with those trade-offs are acceptable.\\nThe other lesson that we would like to highlight is that—despite our confidence \\nin a kind of pluralism about fairness measures—some general patterns exist, and \\nbeing aware of these patterns can help in making decisions about which measures \\nto use. Here are four themes from our discussion of principles and scores: 1) As \\ndemonstrated by the graduate school cases, fairness through unawareness and equal-\\nized odds are liable to miss cases of unfairness where qualifications are caused \\nby protected attributes. 2) As evidenced by Jobs and Jobs 2, fairness through una-\\nwareness and equalized odds can misdiagnose cases where protected attributes are \\ngood evidence of qualifications. 3) While counterfactual fairness can at least some-\\ntimes correct for these shortcomings, it has its own flaws; as Law School Success 2 \\nshows, counterfactual fairness can miss unfairness where qualifications are unfair \\nbecause, for instance, they are not under subjects’ control. 4) As Internship dem-\\nonstrates, counterfactual fairness can—much like fairness through unawareness and \\nequalized odds—misdiagnose cases where protected attributes are good evidence of \\nqualifications.\\nConclusion\\nWe hope to have shown that there is good reason for those interested in machine fair-\\nness to pay more attention to the normative concerns that undergird choices of fair-\\nness measures. We also hope to have provided—in the form of our ‘general picture’ \\nand our exploration of the space of measures—some helpful tools and observations \\n35 For what it is worth, satisfying various other fairness measures also requires (to varying degrees) sac-\\nrificing accuracy. And so this question arises, and the following considerations apply, for many other \\nmeasures in addition to counterfactual fairness.\\n263\\n1 3\\nEgalitarian Machine Learning  \\nfor thinking about choices of measures. Finally, we hope to have shown that there \\nare (at least as yet) no magic bullets here—there is not one measure appropriate for \\nall contexts; rather, there are many scores to choose from and much careful work to \\nbe done in choosing which one to use in a particular context.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to audiences at University of Memphis Fed Ex Institute of Technol-\\nogy, Cal Poly San Louis Obispo,the EnTIRE (Engineering Tools for Innovation and Research in Educa-\\ntion) workshop series, California State University Long Beach, the Copenhagen Workshop on Algorith-\\nmic Fairness, the 2021 AAAI/ACM Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Society (AIES), \\nWeRobot 2021, and two anonymous reviewers at Res Publica.

The goal of our algorithmic solution is to \\nimprove and automate the recruitment of temporary workers to find the best match with existing job offers. We \\ndiscuss how fairness should be a key focus of human resources management and highlight the main challenges \\nand flaws in the research that arise when developing algorithmic solutions to match candidates with job offers. \\nAfter an in-depth analysis of the distribution and biases of our proprietary data set, we describe the methodology \\nused to evaluate the effectiveness and fairness of our machine learning model as well as solutions to correct some \\nbiases. The model we introduce constitutes the first step in our effort to control for unfairness in the outcomes of \\nmachine learning algorithms in job recruitment, and more broadly a responsible use of artificial intelligence in \\nHuman Resources Management thanks to “safeguard algorithms” tasked to control for biases and prevent \\ndiscriminatory outcomes.   \\n1. Introduction \\nIn this article we address the issue of a responsible use of Artificial \\nIntelligence (AI) (i.e., “an agent that perceives and acts in an environ-\\nment” to maximize its chance of achieving its goals (Russell and Norvig, \\n2010)) in Human Resources Technologies (HR Tech). We combine a \\ndiscussion on research and operational issues related to responsible \\ntechnology and fairness with the introduction of a solution powered by \\nmachine learning: a scoring algorithm able to identify the most relevant \\ntemporary workers for a job description issued by an employer. This \\nalgorithmic solution aims at not only automating how the curriculum \\nvitæ of a job candidate is parsed and matched with job descriptions and \\noffers, but also how “safeguard algorithms” designed to try to prevent \\n(some) biases, and therefore offer less unfair outcomes. It seemed \\nimportant to us to illustrate how previous work on fairness-by-design \\nand responsible technology shaped the research and development of \\nthe job matching algorithm that we introduce. \\n1.1. Human Resources Technology & Artificial Intelligence \\nHuman Resources Technology (HR Tech) is a fast moving business \\nsector (Cheng and Hackett, 2021) increasingly leveraging Artificial In-\\ntelligence (AI)  (Meijerink et al., 2021) to power software and hardware \\nsolutions that would assist HR specialists and (sometimes) automate and \\nimprove Human Resources Management (HRM)-related tasks such as \\nemployee payroll and benefits, recruitment/talent acquisition and \\nmanagement, performance assessment as well as re-skilling and ups-\\nkilling processes and workforce-related (predictive) analytics (Liu et al., \\n2022; Mainka, 2019). \\nHR Tech is one of the sectors where AI has the potential to redefine a \\n* Corresponding author. \\nE-mail addresses: sebastien.delecraz@gojob.com (S.

Although \\ndefining AI remains an issue to many experts (Wang, 2019). Here we will \\nuse AI to refer machine and/or deep learning algorithms able to auto-\\nmate and therefore improve quantitatively the job matching process \\nbetween jobseekers and job offers over time. It also offers qualitative \\nimprovement since algorithms offer the prospect of faster, more accu-\\nrate, and more consistent HRM outcomes thanks to scientific and tech-\\nnological insights coming from fields such as Natural Language \\nProcessing (NLP), as well as behavioural and brain sciences. Machine \\nlearning is already doing a great job at identifying the skills and moti-\\nvation of candidates and at predicting job fit and performance (Tanash \\net al., 2019; Yoo et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2018; Zhu, 2021). \\nAs AI-based solutions become more popular in HRM, and therefore \\nmore influential, individuals and organizations that design, develop, \\nand implement these solutions must ensure that the innovative solutions \\nthey introduce are ethical and inclusive in order to avoid discriminatory \\nand unfair outcomes, as already observed. K¨ochling and Wehner (2020) \\nmade a review of this field; Cheng and Hackett (2021) conducted a \\ncritical review of algorithms in HRM. In other words, HR Tech must be a \\nresponsible technology. \\nAccording to Stilgoe et al. (2013), there are four dimensions of \\nresponsible innovation/technology: anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, \\nand responsiveness (see also the works of Andrews (2019) for an \\nexample of responsible technology policy in the private sector). One can \\ntherefore wonder whether HR Tech is a responsible technology. Of \\ncourse, it is impossible to make a blanket statement over an entire sector \\nlike HR Tech, even if it is still in its infancy compared to more estab-\\nlished ones such as healthcare, food and agriculture, transportation or \\nenergy. Yet, one can still wonder whether HR Tech is making a truly \\npositive impact on society (rather than causing new issues), which \\nwould be one of the prerequisites to calling any technology responsible. \\nIn order to be deemed responsible, HR Tech must be ethical and \\nnon-discriminatory. \\nIn business and academia, we do hear more and more key players \\nadvocating for innovation to be ethical by design (Fritz et al., 2020; \\nRadclyffe and Nodell, 2020). For Dignum et al. (2018) “Ethics by Design \\nconcerns the methods, algorithms and tools needed to endow autono-\\nmous agents with the capability to reason about the ethical aspects of \\ntheir decisions, and the methods, tools and formalisms to guarantee that \\nan agent’s behavior remains within given moral bounds”. As much as we \\nsupport this claim, it is also our belief that being ethical is mandatory, \\nbut \\nnot \\nsufficient. \\nInnovation \\nmust \\nalso \\nbe \\ninclusive \\nand \\nnon-discriminatory, in other words, it must be fair by design (Feuer-\\nriegel et al., 2020). Fair by design matching algorithms were built for \\nvarious purposes ranging from organ donation (García-Soriano and \\nBonchi, 2020) to judicial selection (Zhu et al., 2018) (see also the works \\nof Veale et al. (2018) for a discussion on fairness and accountability in \\nalgorithm development). It implies that, in addition to outcomes being \\nethical, and therefore within moral bounds, algorithms should not \\ndiscriminate between individuals and provide, as much as possible, \\nequal opportunities. In the context of a job matching algorithm, previous \\nwork has explored the benefits of a fair by design development of HRM \\n(Morgan, 2008). Yet, one can then wonder what it means for an algo-\\nrithm(ic solution) to be fair since (un)fairness comes in many shapes and \\nforms and its appreciation can be highly context dependent (see the \\nworks of Robert et al. (2020) for a framework that illustrates fair \\norganizational AI-based management solutions). \\n2. Responsible Artificial Intelligence: A Combination of Public \\nPolicy and Self-regulation \\nAs artificial intelligence became pervasive, legitimate concerns \\nstarted to grow at the societal level regarding the so-called “black box” \\nfunctioning of AI-powered solutions developed for commercial pur-\\nposes. Some of these concerns are justified when the output of algo-\\nrithms exhibits obvious biases (Srinivasan and Chander, 2021) that lead \\nto unfairness in the way people are benefiting (or not) from AI-assisted \\nsolutions. Or worse, when the decisions (Rastogi et al., 2020) informed \\nor taken by AI algorithms lead to obvious discrimination (Ferrer et al., \\n2021; Miller, 2020) or mistakes that cannot be easily identified even \\nwhen second opinions are required to correct them (Cabitza, 2019). This \\nissue is key in many business sectors including in human resources \\nmanagement where automated decisions made by algorithms can have \\ndramatic consequences on someone’s professional career (Pillai and \\nSivathanu, 2020; Yano, 2017). Requiring algorithmic transparency is \\nnecessary to improve the confidence of its users, but hard to implement. \\nOne of the reasons is the clear tension between businesses wanting to \\nprotect intellectual property that required millions of dollars invested in \\nresearch and development and the moral and legal need for trans-\\nparency and accountability (Castets-Renard, 2020; Meyer and Fernan-\\ndez, 2019). \\nA significant number of companies have taken proactive steps to not \\nonly introduce principles and guidelines (Golbin and Axente, 2021; \\nPesenti, 2021; Pichai, 2018) when it comes to using AI, but to make \\nthem operational (e.g., Microsoft company1). Although there is no real \\nconsensus regarding the way these principles are presented or imple-\\nmented, they should involve epistemic principles and more general \\nethical principles (Castets-Renard, 2020). Yet, although companies \\ncommit (genuinely or for public relation risk mitigation purposes) to \\nresponsible AI principles, there is not yet a standard guiding the road \\nfrom principles to implementation and regulation ((Jobin et al., 2019) \\nhighlight a degree of emerging consensus on this topic). \\nInterestingly, responsible AI has become a business within the \\nbusiness. Professional services firms offer to assist companies in their \\nimplementation of responsible AI principles (Mills et al., 2020), and \\nspecific tech solutions are now available to assist companies, such as \\nCredo AI2 offering “an end-to-end governance platform for managing \\ncompliance and measuring risk for your AI deployments at scale”. \\nIt is noteworthy that, because they are under constant public \\nopinion, media and regulatory scrutiny, big tech companies have made \\nsignificant (and visible) efforts to adopt and most of the time implement \\nresponsible AI principles. These initiatives, although gaining mo-\\nmentum, are not generalized yet in the startup ecosystem but should \\nbecome the norm as soon as possible. Some small business do their best \\nto try to fly under the radar when it comes to responsible AI or assess-\\nment of the reality of their AI solutions because of the “fake AI” issue, (i. \\ne., companies pretending to develop AI solutions when they are not \\n(Schmelzer, 2020)). This is not a sustainable stance from both a busi-\\nness, ethical and regulatory perspectives. \\nRecently, the European Commission (EC), issued proposal 2021/ \\n0106(COD) entitled “Laying down harmonized rules on Artificial Intel-\\nligence (the Artificial Intelligence Act) and amending certain union \\nlegislative acts” (Commision, 2021). What is referred to as “EC’s Arti-\\nficial Intelligence Act” was issued to:  \\n1. Ensure that AI systems placed on the Union market and used are safe \\nand respect existing law on fundamental rights and Union values;  \\n2. Ensure legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in AI;  \\n3. Enhance governance and effective enforcement of existing law on \\nfundamental rights and safety requirements applicable to AI systems;  \\n4. Facilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and \\ntrustworthy AI applications and prevent market fragmentation. \\nAmongst the many points raised, transparency obligations for \\n“certain” AI systems are highlighted, as well guidelines for governance \\nand implementation, while not preventing innovation. The EC effort is \\nto be supported, and seems to gain momentum abroad. For instance, in \\nNovember 2010, the US Director of the National AI Initiative at the \\n1 www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/our-approach?activetab=pivot1:primaryr5  \\n2 www.credo.ai \\nS. Delecraz et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\nJournal of Responsible Technology 11 (2022) 100041\\n3\\nWhite House Office of Science and Technology Policy, as she was \\nspeaking at an event organized by Fortune Magazine, hinted at the US \\nhaving to model Europe’s approach to AI regulation (Reilly, 2021). In \\nthe United States, as of 2021, artificial intelligence bills were introduced \\nin seventeenth states and enacted in four of them3. \\n2.1. The Context-Dependent Perception of Fairness \\nThe mere definition of fairness does not meet consensus across all the \\nacademic fields that have investigated it and tried to address the topic \\nover the past centuries. The strong context-dependence of (the percep-\\ntion of) fairness makes it all the more complicated for all stakeholders in \\nHRM to create or buy fair AI-based solutions (Horak, 2018). \\nSince this article discusses AI and fairness in the context of auto-\\nmated workplace job matching and recruitment processes, we thought a \\ngood starting point would be to look at the definition of fairness pro-\\nvided by the Collins dictionary: “Fairness is the quality of being \\nreasonable, right, and just”. This definition does not take into account \\nthe complexity and multidimensionality of fairness (Arneson, 2016; \\nSabrina Strang, 2015). In order to get a better idea of the various angles \\nthat can be taken to approach fairness in AI, we would advise the reader \\nto refer to the work of Verma and Rubin (2018) who collected “the most \\nprominent definitions of fairness for the algorithmic classification \\nproblem, explain[ed] the rationale behind these definitions, and \\ndemonstrate[d] each of them on a single unifying case-study”. \\nMehrabi et al. (2021) define fairness as “the absence of any prejudice \\nor favoritism toward an individual or a group based on their inherent or \\nacquired characteristics”. Of course, there are many other definitions of \\nfairness, but from an operational standpoint, in our everyday lives, \\nfairness is often a perception and a personal appreciation that one has of \\na situation (and/or the outcomes of a decision) at a given moment in \\ntime and in a given social setting (Getnet et al., 2014). Like beauty – or \\nmany other judgments that we make on a daily basis – fairness lies in the \\neye of the beholder. There is therefore a high level of intra- and inter-\\npersonal variability when one needs to address whether a decision is fair \\nfor example (Jun and Yefeng, 2015; Ramalingam, 2010). The reason is \\nthat, like many other things in our lives, fairness appreciation is \\nmodulated by a multitude of contextual factors, such as cultural differ-\\nences, level of education or even gender or age (Petersen et al., 2014; \\nWitt and Nye, 1992). \\nFairness can even be associated with a visceral reaction (Slovic et al., \\n2004), a feeling that us, humans, could experience following something \\nthat happened in our lives. The fairness appreciation and neural pro-\\ncessing associated with it is highly context-dependent as illustrated by \\nstudies in philosophy (Ryan, 2006), social psychology (Van den Bos \\net al., 2003; Platow et al., 2000), game theory (Rabin, 1993), and more \\nrecently in behavioural economics (Camerer and Loewenstein, 2003), \\nsocial cognitive and affective neuroscience (Guroglu et al., 2010; Mor-\\netti and Di Pellegrino, 2010) and neuro-economics (Oullier et al., 2008). \\n2.2. Unfair Tools in Human Resources Management \\nIn human resources management, and more particularly in recruit-\\nment and job matching processes, the “technology” that has been the \\nmost popular and widely used over the past decades by organizations is \\nrooted in questionnaires, surveys, and tests (Emre, 2018). Such declar-\\native methods are used with the hope of capturing someone’s person-\\nality traits, cognitive abilities and skills, but also to provide predictive \\ninsights regarding job fit as well as success or failure in job performance. \\nIn other words, a series of questions is supposed to unveil the complexity \\nof a candidate’s behaviour, personality, affective reactions, skills, and \\nbrain functioning. But there is a major problem. The reliability and \\npredictive power of recruitment tests has been extensively challenged \\nsince the 1970s when the first peer-reviewed articles were published \\ndemonstrating the limitations and flaws of questionnaires and self--\\nreports (Nisbett and Wilson, 1977). \\nUnlike psychological states that evolve over time, traits (that some \\nHRM tests claim they can capture) should not sensitive to context. This \\nmeans that any methodology meant to measure personality traits that \\nwould not produce statistically similar outcomes under various contexts \\nshould not be considered fair in our opinion. \\nThe most common way to assess the reliability of a personality test is \\nthe “test-retest” approach consisting in taking a given test once, and \\ntaking it again some time later. This is what some scientists started to do \\nmore than forty years ago with one of the most popular test ever, that is \\nstill very much used in HRM nowadays (Howes and Carskadon, 1979). \\n“Even when the test-retest interval is short (e.g., 5 weeks), as many as \\nfifty percent of the people will be classified into a different type” reports \\nPittenger (1993), a behavioural scientist and foremost expert in per-\\nsonality tests who has extensively published on this topic (Pittenger, \\n2005). \\nWhether for the lack of anything better or because of the impossi-\\nbility to implement more rigorous solutions at scale, public and private \\norganizations still rely heavily on declarative methods in human re-\\nsources management despite more than forty years of solid scientific \\nliterature highlighting their lack of reliability, reproducibility, and \\npredictive power of job fit or performance. For nearly fifty years, the \\nprofessional careers (and by extension the professional and personal \\nlives) of millions of individuals have been shaped by the results of such \\nunfair declarative methods. Fortunately, new more rigorous approaches \\nare gaining momentum as video-based interviews and analytics \\n(Hemamou et al., 2019) or gamified assessment protocols (Nair and \\nSadasivan, 2019) opening doors to potential improvement and reli-\\nability in talent acquisition and recruitment processes, especially when \\npowered by AI (Eubanks, 2022). \\nIn addition to the reliability (and therefore ethical) issues associated \\nwith recruitment tools rooted in declarative methods and self-reports, \\nassessments of the competencies and job fitness of candidates can be \\ninfluenced by the state of mind of the recruiters themselves. How \\nstressed recruiters feel while assessing a candidate(’s profile), how their \\nown personal experience relates (or not) to that of the candidate, or how \\nmuch they like the technology supposed to assist, and even compassion \\nfatigue, are amongst the wealth of factor that can alter their assessments \\nduring a recruitment process (Anderson, 2003; Bartone and Bowles, \\n2020; Huang et al., 2013; Ivanovic et al., 2020; Jones, 2018; Tehrani, \\n2010). Poor job matching and recruitment can possibly lead to em-\\nployees experiencing distress, mental health issues and bad job perfor-\\nmances (Fordjour et al., 2020). Another consequence of bad hires not to \\nbe neglected: increased financial costs for the recruiting organization \\n(Fujita and Ramey, 2007). This is simply not acceptable. \\n2.3. Towards Fair Algorithmic Job Matching Outcomes \\nLeveraging the power of large scale data sets and machine learning \\nalgorithms, combined with behavioural and brain sciences, helps better \\nunderstand the skills of people applying for jobs and providing them \\nwith the best job matching service. It can help make job offers more \\ninclusive and less discriminatory. However, the fact that what was \\navailable before the advent of AI in HRM (i.e., declarative tests, see \\nearlier paragraphs) was not only scientifically questionable (and ques-\\ntioned) but unfair, does not prevent us from putting the question of \\nfairness at the core of research and development of the AI and algo-\\nrithms powering new HRM solutions. It is not just necessary, but \\nmandatory for us to do our best to make the outcomes of our algorithms \\nas fair as possible. \\nWhat the incredible body of theoretical and field work on fairness \\nproduced by scholars in so many academic fields reveals how complex it \\nis to measure, interpret, model, and implement this concept. \\n3 www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technolog \\ny/2020-legislation-related-to-artificial-intelligence.aspx \\nS. Delecraz et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\nJournal of Responsible Technology 11 (2022) 100041\\n4\\nUnsurprisingly it has a lead to some differences in the way fairness is \\nmathematically modelled and implemented versus the human percep-\\ntion of fairness, as illustrated by the works of Srivastava et al. (2019) and \\nof Verma and Rubin (2018). \\nIn the following sections, we advocate that a responsible use of AI in \\nHRM must include machine learning-based feedback and safeguard \\nmechanisms to prevent automated decision-making processes and out-\\ncomes from being discriminatory, unethical and therefore unfair. A \\nresponsible HR Tech solution should be powered by a new breed of job \\nmatching algorithms and HRM solutions that can significantly improve \\nmatching speed and efficacy, and therefore benefit the professional lives \\nand careers of individuals, and the functioning of the organizations \\nemploying them (Johnson et al., 2020; Tewari and Pant, 2020). But in \\naddition to quantitative performance, qualitative safeguards are \\nmandatory to avoid, as best as possible, biases in algorithmic decisions \\nthat would lead to discriminatory outcomes. \\nWe introduce the methodological approach employed in developing \\nour matching algorithm between job offers and workers, while doing our \\nbest to avoid the pitfall of unfairness and discrimination. Our approach \\nto algorithm development is guided by the constant objective of offering \\na solution at the cutting edge of technology that has at its core a strict \\npolicy of being as fair and transparent as possible. \\nThe job matching algorithm introduced in this article is a tool for \\ninternal recruiters to help them staff their specific request in the mini-\\nmum of time. Its development is driven by three principles:  \\n1. to perform the most relevant and responsible recommendations to \\nmatch a specific job description;  \\n2. to do it in the shortest amount of time;  \\n3. to make sure that the algorithm processes the most up-to-date \\ndataset. \\nOne of the main concerns is for everyone in our database of job-\\nseekers to be provided with equal chances to be recruited regardless \\ntheir age, gender, origin, as long as they are the best fit with the job offer \\nin terms of skills, professional experience and education. In our \\napproach, the key features should be the worker’s professional experi-\\nence and motivation, the latter being assessed thanks to a combination \\nof natural language processing and cognitive features embedded in our \\nalgorithm. It is noteworthy that focusing on professional experience \\nwould likely disadvantage groups who have fewer years of experience \\n(for example due to pregnancy). Therefore, it is crucial to check whether \\nthe model makes predictions based on the relevance and the quality of \\nan application and not on other criteria that may be correlated or \\nconfounded. An algorithm should not only be considered in light of its \\nperformance and outcomes according to a given set of metrics, but also \\naccording to the context in which its outcomes (i.e., the decision it \\nmakes) are being used. All things considered it is also important to \\nrealize that a fair algorithm does not necessary means that the outcomes \\nof its decisions are equal. \\nFairness was above all a philosophical and sociological matter before \\nit became a technological one. Its study and implementation within the \\nframework of AI is formalized by the definition of a set of rules and \\nequations allowing its quantification and verification. \\nNot including information such as gender, age, or birth country \\ncould, in some instances, contribute to improve the fairness of outcomes, \\nin theory. However, there are cases such as classification or association \\nrules where the exclusion of these pieces of information about the \\ncandidate have shown not be effective in order to produce fair outcomes \\n(Pedreshi et al., 2008). In fact, few metrics (Castelnovo et al., 2021) are \\nparticularly used: predictive parity (Verma and Rubin, 2018), de-\\nmographic parity and equalized odds (Hardt et al., 2016). Being able to \\ncontrol for the three aforementioned features turns out to be not only \\nvery difficult, but can turn to be counterproductive as illustrated by \\nKleinberg et al. (2017) who provided statistical evidence for their \\nmutual exclusion in most cases. \\n2.4. Data distribution and bias analysis \\nWe want to ensure that no particular group is discriminated by our \\nmodel. Our proprietary database is constituted of applications made by \\ntemporary workers in France applying for jobs. The atomic item is \\ncomposed by the set of attributes from a temporary worker, the set of \\ninformation from the job description to which the work could (or would) \\napply for and a label which describes the outcome of the application (1 if \\nthe worker was recruited, 0 otherwise). To be consistent with our vision, \\nwe focused on sensitive attributes including gender, nationality, birth \\ncountry, need for residence permit (some foreigners need a residence \\npermit) and education (some workers have declared an education but \\nsome did not). \\nWe assume for instance that workers who need a residence permit \\nare more likely to be negatively affected by the model through a bias the \\nmodel could find in the database. The same thing goes for the other \\nsensitive attributes. Therefore, we use dummy variables to categorize \\nwhat we assume would be a group of candidates that would be “fav-\\noured” by the algorithm, as opposed to the group that would be \\n“discriminated” by it:  \\n• gender: male or female;  \\n• nationality: French nationality or not;  \\n• place of birth: born in France or not;  \\n• education: has declared an education level or not;  \\n• residence permit (RP) requirement: can work without a residence \\npermit or need to have one;  \\n• 18-25: in the 18-25 age range or not;  \\n• 25-35: in the 25-35 age range or not;  \\n• 35-45: in the 35-45 age range or not;  \\n• 45-55: in the 45-55 age range or not. \\nWe conducted an analysis across these sensitive attributes to assess \\nthe fairness of the outcomes provided by our model using the Equal \\nOpportunities notion as defined by the FairLearn toolkit (Bird et al., \\n2020). Before implementing a fair algorithm, we analysed the data to \\nobserve possible biases or under-representation of some categories. \\nTable 1 indicates the size of each population, along with every sensitive \\nattribute broken down in two outcome categories (recruited versus not \\nrecruited) and by the value of each sensitive attribute (assumed to \\nbelong to the favoured group versus discriminated one). For instance, \\nwe can see that the label has the same distribution no matter the gender. \\nIndeed, the gap between the number of males that are recruited and \\nthose who are not is not significantly different from the difference be-\\ntween the number of recruited females versus the ones who are not \\nrecruited. \\nOur goal is to be able to identify some unjustified dependencies be-\\ntween outcome group and sensitive attributes in our data set. For \\ninstance female candidates are historically less prone to be favoured \\ncompared to male ones (in our case, to have their job application \\nTable 1 \\nSize of the population for profiles that are recruited versus not recruited crossed \\nwith them belonging to the (assumed to be) favoured versus discriminated \\ngroup.   \\nRecruited \\nNot recruited \\nAttributes \\nFavoured \\nDiscriminated \\nFavoured \\nDiscriminated \\ngender \\n71,429 \\n31,663 \\n70,598 \\n32,494 \\nnationality \\n67,298 \\n22,500 \\n27,601 \\n25,248 \\nplace of birth \\n60,517 \\n24,868 \\n17,700 \\n16,136 \\neducation \\n33,246 \\n69,846 \\n24,444 \\n78,648 \\nRP requirement \\n70,681 \\n19,117 \\n32,976 \\n19,873 \\n18-25 years old \\n29,317 \\n60,437 \\n19,223 \\n33,744 \\n25-35 years old \\n32,378 \\n57,376 \\n20,033 \\n32,934 \\n35-45 years old \\n16,866 \\n72,888 \\n9,259 \\n43,708 \\n45-55 years old \\n8,539 \\n81,215 \\n3,431 \\n49,536  \\nS.

The same goes with the other attributes previously \\nmentioned. The reader is invited to kindly keep in mind that this first \\nstep is not about analysing the model nor its consequences but truly to \\nhighlight unfairness in the data set. For the data analysis part, we \\ncompute two scores which allow us to appreciate the (dis)parity in \\nrecruitment processes. We define a sensitive attribute A which indicates \\nthat one individual belongs to a group considered as discriminated and A \\nto the privileged group. Considering variable Y to describe the outcome \\nof the jobseeker’s application, we first computed, for each attribute, the \\nDisparate Impact on the data: \\nDisparate Impact = P(Y = 1|A)\\nP(Y = 1|A)\\n(1)  \\nThe first equation expresses a comparison between two probabilities: i) \\nthe probability for a member of the discriminated group to have the \\nfavourable outcome (to be recruited in our case); ii) the probability for a \\nmember of the favoured group to have the favourable outcome. The \\nsecond equation is the one to calculate Statistical Parity: \\nStatistical Parity = P(Y = 1|A) − P(Y = 1|A)\\n(2)  \\nUsing both Disparate Impact and Statistical Parity provides a broader \\nvision and enables us to find effects that could have been hidden by the \\ndistribution of data. \\nGiven these equations, there is no pre-determined threshold (neither \\nby law nor by regulations) for which an observation is considered as \\nbiased or not. Feldman et al. (2015) argues that a correct Disparate \\nImpact should not be less than 0.8 and not greater than 1.25. These \\nboundaries are based on the “80% rule” recommended by the US Equal \\nEmployment Opportunity Commission4. Regarding Statistical Parity, \\nwithout a well-define threshold in the scientific literature, we consider a \\ngap of -0.1 too large to be unconsidered in job recruitment. For instance, \\nthis could mean that a man would have 10% more chance to have his \\napplication chosen. Table 2 presents these two scores for all the sensitive \\nattributes we studied. \\nWe can see there is no clear imbalance when it comes to age or \\ngender. For these variables, Disparate Impact is quite close to 1 and \\nStatistical Parity is close to 0. This means there is no strong under- \\nrepresentation of women among the approved applications compared \\nto men and vice versa. If we consider nationality for instance, Disparate \\nImpact is particularly low and Statistical Parity is particularly far below \\nzero. This shows that the frequency of approved job applications for \\npeople who are not French is significantly lower than for French people. \\nWe could give the same description for some other variables such as \\nbeing born in France, education and whether the person does need a \\nresidence permit. \\nHere we clearly see that label distribution is not the same across \\nsensitive attributes. The assumed to be the favoured group (people of \\nFrench nationality) usually benefit from the preferred outcome while \\nforeign applicants get the preferred outcome roughly half of the time. \\nFrom this analysis and examination of our data, we did find biases \\nand under-representation that are identified for not all but a few of the \\ndefined variables (RP requirement, education, nationality, and place of \\nbirth). Our data is based on accurate events and is only meant to describe \\nhuman behaviour. This does not mean a model trained on this data will \\ngenerate discriminatory rules since the model is not informed about \\nsensitive attributes. We do think that, this approach represents an \\nappropriate methodology to understand the data. We can also observe \\nthe dependency between the label and the sensitive attribute. \\n2.5. Proposed Fairness Guidelines \\nWhen it comes to supervised learning tasks in a human resources \\nmanagement context, the Equality of Opportunity metric is often \\nconsidered the more relevant one in the scientific literature (Hardt et al., \\n2016). If ̂Y is a binary predictor of the outcome of a worker application \\nand Y the associated ground truth, we consider Class 1 as the preferred \\noutcome in the classification task (the worker was recruited). Given a \\nsensitive attribute A indicating the belonging to a group considered as \\ndiscriminated and A the belonging to the favoured group, ̂Y is consid-\\nered equal opportunity with respect to sensitive attribute A if: \\nP(̂Y = 1|Y = 1, A) = P(̂Y = 1|Y = 1, A)\\n(3)  \\nThis equation could also be written in terms of another statistical metric: \\nthe True Positive Rate (TPR). Given the number of true positives TP and \\nthe number of false negatives FN, we compute TPR = TP/(TP + FN). \\nWhich gives us as new formulation of the equation  (3): \\nTPRA = TPRA\\n(3.1)  \\nIn light of Equation 3.1 we define the True Positive Ratio Parity as: \\nTPRP = |TPRA − TPRA|\\n(4)  \\nThis particular metric shows a couple of advantages.  \\n1. It allows the perfectly accurate solution to be right, whereas the \\ndemographic parity metric might describe accurate data as inap-\\npropriate. This fact would not make sense in the context of our work \\nsince we are training a model to approximate the ground truth.  \\n2. It compares the ability of the model across groups to select relevant \\nprofiles.  \\n3. It penalizes the model who perform well on the majority group. \\nThe second point addressed above is particularly important in the \\ncontext of job matching and recruitment. For instance, a hiring agent \\nwould rather select too many candidates than too few. If the True Positive \\nRate for males were really high(er) compared to the True Positive Rate \\nfor females, then the model would either select relevant profiles \\namongst males more accurately than female relevant profiles. Or the \\nmodel would select irrelevant male profiles more often than it would \\nselect irrelevant female profiles. Using this fairness definition is in fact \\nrequiring non-discrimination only within the preferred outcome. One \\ncan see that this vision of fairness is more than a probabilistic equation \\nbecause it is linked to an ideology or a philosophical belief. The TPRP is \\nnot a normalized concept, and we are conscious of (bias toward what we \\nconsider) a meritocratic approach is therefore favoured. \\nIdeally, we would set a doorstep or a reference value for this metric. \\nAn “alarm threshold” to which we will compare our assessments. \\nHowever, as far as we know there is no clear recommendation or \\nhandbook in the literature on which value to consider. Therefore, we \\nchose ours somewhat arbitrarily, yet based on our own experience. The \\nthreshold itself is meant to ensure there is no group who is \\nTable 2 \\nDisparate Impact and Statistical Parity in our dataset.  \\nAttributes \\nDisparate Impact \\nStatistical Parity \\ngender \\n0.98 \\n-0.01 \\n18-25 years old \\n1.06 \\n0.04 \\n25-35 years old \\n1.03 \\n0.02 \\n35-45 years old \\n0.97 \\n-0.02 \\n45-55years old \\n0.87 \\n-0.09 \\nRP requirement \\n0.72 \\n-0.19 \\neducation \\n0.82 \\n-0.11 \\nnationality \\n0.66 \\n-0.24 \\nplace of birth \\n0.78 \\n-0.17  \\n4 The U.S. EEOC.

Such a True Positive Rate Parity value bears \\nthe following question “If we consider relevant applications only, how \\noften do we predict correctly those who belong to a group A versus a \\ngroup B?”. \\n2.5.1. Fairness Assessment \\nAfter analysing our data, the next step consists in evaluating the \\nimpact of our matching model. We examined how the model performs \\nbased on the Equal Opportunity fairness definition. In order to have a \\nbroader view on how the model behaves, we have chosen to use a \\ntwofold cross validation method to reduce randomness. We therefore \\ncomputed the average True Positive Rate Parity together with the F1- \\nScore and area under the ROC Curve (AUC) to better understand how \\nthe model behaves. \\nAs illustrated in Table 3, across every sensitive attribute, our model \\nexhibits fine F1-Score and AUC. Our model does not make undesirable \\ndecisions in order to have a fair output. We can also observe that the \\ndifferent TPRP values reach a maximum 4.54% for the attribute defining \\nwhether the worker is French or not. As mentioned before, we do not \\nhave a clear threshold concerning this metric. This said, a binary vision \\nwhere a side of a threshold would be right, and the other side wrong is \\nnot necessarily relevant. For instance, the issue is more to make sure \\nthere is no group that is disproportionately harmed or disadvantaged \\ncompared to another one. All TPRP scores obtained in output of our \\nmodel are below 5%. Having the trade knowledge in hiring and also by \\ninteracting with experienced in-house recruiters, we consider this \\nthreshold a good baseline for future iteration of the model at the core of \\nour machine learning solution. \\n2.5.2. Unfairness Mitigation \\nIn our approach to developing fair algorithms, we embraced general \\nartificial intelligence fairness and ethics guidelines (Hagendorff, 2020) \\nbut we also needed to consider technical mitigation techniques. Several \\napproaches have already been introduced. \\nHardt et al. (2016) proposed to achieve equal opportunity by \\nderiving a given predictor. Such an approach bears interesting advan-\\ntages including being model insensitive and focusing on optimizing \\nequal opportunity outcomes while keeping an attractive loss function \\ncompared to the predictor it is derived from. But it also requires to \\nconstantly include the sensitive attribute in every step. This is not ideal \\nfor us since we have many missing values in the real world application of \\nour model. Pre-processing interventions were proposed to transform the \\ndata in order to reduce correlations (Calmon et al., 2017; Feldman et al., \\n2015). However, these techniques are meant to mitigate any excess in \\nthe True Positive Rate Parity and are not the most relevant when \\nconsidering an Equal Opportunity definition. \\nA promising approach was introduced by Agarwal et al. (2018). The \\nexponential gradient algorithm for unfairness reduction appears to be \\nthe most relevant one as far as we are concerned. The model performs \\ngood results for a classification task. Moreover, this method benefits \\nfrom requiring the sensitive attribute in the training part only. This \\napproach is particularly attractive in a context where we are concerned \\nby deployment problems and issues. \\nThe remaining problem is that we still need sensitive attributes in our \\nprocess. Therefore, implementing and deploying this approach in our \\nmachine learning R&D pipelines would mean to train the model on a \\nsubset of our database. This would not be coherent with one of the \\nprinciples at the core of machine learning fairness: diversity (Schu-\\nmann, 2020). Avoiding missing values means reducing diversity. Some \\nmissing data might provide information that is key to better profile \\n(groups of) individuals. \\n3. A Realistic Framework For Algorithmic Fairness \\nHoping for AI to be objective, neutral or unbiased does not make any \\nsense since objectivity, neutrality and unbiased simply do not exist. \\nWhat responsible technology should be expected to do is to provide the \\nmost rigorous and transparent methodology to provide a service or to \\nreach a certain outcome. And a set of principles coupled with actionable \\nguidelines to implement them while complying to existing regulatory \\nmeasures and upcoming ones is necessary. Above and beyond, it is \\nmandatory to put fairness and human wellness and safety at the core of \\nthe thought, design, and implementation processes when it comes to \\nresponsible AI-powered (HRM) solutions. \\nAs creators of artificial intelligence and machine-learning based so-\\nlutions in the HR Tech sector to help people find the best professional fit, \\nit is our duty not only to understand but to be able to explain and justify \\nall the decisions made by our algorithms. These decisions must be \\nmethodologically and scientifically rigorous as well as evidence- \\ninformed. \\nAlthough the work focusing on defining and studying fairness with a \\nmultidisciplinary approach dates back to the 1960s (Hutchinson and \\nMitchell, 2019), the interest in machine learning research in this area \\nhas only really boomed in the mid 2010s (Caton and Haas, 2020). As \\nRaghavan et al. (2020) points out in their article, it can be difficult for an \\nexternal entity to study the fairness of the models used by a company, \\nand the often sensitive and proprietary data that the models are \\ncrunching. It is therefore key for the effort on fairness to be embedded as \\nsoon as the first mathematical models are created. \\nvan den Broek et al. (2020) acknowledge how complex it is to take \\nfairness issues into account in recruitment processes, but they also offer \\ninteresting guidelines to considering when one wants to build respon-\\nsible and fair AI (see the works of Jobin et al. (2019) and Floridi and \\nCowls (2019) for a unified framework of principles for AI in society). \\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about AI, is that it is meant to do \\nthings better than a human. In a lot of cases, it does. But AI should be \\ndeveloped to do things differently. Humans make mistakes, and part of \\nthe social contract, across centuries, has been to monitor, correct, \\nanticipate and sometimes punish when these mistakes are made. There \\nis also a form of understanding, if not tolerance for some of these mis-\\ntakes. Algorithms are not humans. Hence, our tolerance for algorithmic \\nmistakes should be lower than our tolerance for human error. For a \\nsignificant portion of them, algorithms are developed by humans, or by \\nother algorithms, that at one point were developed by humans. \\nThe human factor comes with greatness and flaws such as biases. Yet, \\nas addressed in some of our previous work (Oullier and Basso, 2010) it is \\na profound mistake to consider human biases as an exception to a \\n(rational) norm. Biases are everywhere, whether we like it or not they \\nare the norm more than they are the exception. It is not a good thing, it is \\nnot a bad thing, it is just how humans behave despite what supporters of \\na rational approach to economic theory have been disseminating for \\nover a century. This means that data collected on humans and their \\nbehaviours are intrinsically biased. Hence, in addition to addressing the \\nissue of biased algorithms and their unfair outcomes, it is necessary to \\naddress the issues related to biased data sets. \\nIt is therefore our duty, in HR tech, as in any other AI system, not \\nonly to be aware of these issues, but to make sure that we build the right \\nregulations – enforced by regulatory bodies and policymakers as well as \\nTable 3 \\nEvaluation of the performance and fairness of our worker/job offer matcher \\nmodel on each sensitive attribute.  \\nAttributes \\nF1-Score \\nAUC \\nTPRP \\ngender \\n80.29 \\n89.28 \\n3.50 \\nnationality \\n86.25 \\n88.27 \\n3.53 \\nplace of birth \\n89.45 \\n85.66 \\n4.54 \\neducation \\n80.29 \\n89.28 \\n3.98 \\nRP requirement \\n86.25 \\n88.27 \\n2.77 \\n18-25 years old \\n86.30 \\n88.27 \\n0.90 \\n25-35 years old \\n86.30 \\n88.27 \\n0.70 \\n35-45 years old \\n86.30 \\n88.27 \\n0.25 \\n45-55 years old \\n86.30 \\n88.27 \\n0.97  \\nS.

At this stage of its development, our algorithm is not the \\ndecision maker but a tool to assist human recruiters in their decision- \\nmaking process. The final decision still comes to a human being when \\nit comes to matching a CV with a job offer to take human factors that AI \\ncannot (yet) factor in. Yet, the algorithm’s competitive advantage lies in \\nthe speed and amount of CVs it can analyse and select to help the \\nrecruiter. \\n4. Conclusion \\nIn the context of human resources management, we introduced an \\napproach to research and development of artificial intelligence algo-\\nrithms that can predict who the best candidate is for a given job offer \\nwhile controlling for the fairness of its outcomes. We did identify biases \\nacross the process that led to a differential treatment of individuals \\n(some being favoured some being discriminated) as well biases towards \\nsome sensitive information such as owning a resident permit, having a \\ncertain level of education and coming from a certain birthplace. \\nIn light of these biases, we have introduced metrics to assess the level \\nof unfairness in this HRM solution that can correct the outcome to make \\nit fair(er). What we did is embedding in our AI-based automation process \\nalgorithmic safeguards that are informed by possible biases (theory) and \\nmeasured ones (outcomes) in order to make the decisions made by our \\nmachine learning algorithm in charge of automating the matching be-\\ntween job applicants and job offers as fair as possible. \\nThis is the first step in a series of R&D phases where, regardless of the \\ntask to be automated, fairness will be measured, and algorithmic out-\\ncomes will be corrected if our safeguard algorithms estimate that fair-\\nness is not observed. This not only allows to ensure a higher level of \\nfairness in the outcomes provided by our algorithms, but also to improve \\ntransparency and explainability of what (our) algorithms decide. \\nDeclaration of Competing Interest \\nThe authors declare the following financial interests/personal re-\\nlationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: \\nSebastien Delecraz, Loukman Eltarr, Martin Becuwe, Henri Bouxin \\nand Nicolas Boutin are employed by Gojob \\nOlivier Oullier is employed by Aix-Marseille University, Optivo \\nSystems and is a shareholder of Inclusive Brains, EMOTIV and BRAINS4 \\nReferences \\nAgarwal, A., Beygelzimer, A., Dudik, M., Langford, J., & Wallach, H.

of artificial intelligence in human resources  management through the lens of a fairbydesign approach to algorithm development illustrated by the intro duction of a new machine learningbased approach to job matching the goal of our algorithmic solution is to  improve and automate the recruitment of temporary workers to find the best match with existing job offers we  discuss how fairness should be a key focus of human resources management and highlight the main challenges  and flaws in the research that arise when developing algorithmic solutions to match candidates with job offers  after an indepth analysis of the distribution and biases of our proprietary data set we describe the methodology  used to evaluate the effectiveness and fairness of our machine learning model as well as solutions to correct some  biases the model we introduce constitutes the first step in our effort to control for unfairness in the outcomes of  machine learning algorithms in job recruitment and more broadly a responsible use of artificial intelligence in  human resources management thanks to safeguard algorithms tasked to control for biases and prevent  discriminatory outcomes    1 introduction  in this article we address the issue of a responsible use of artificial  intelligence ai ie an agent that perceives and acts in an environ ment to maximize its chance of achieving its goals russell and norvig  2010 in human resources technologies hr tech we combine a  discussion on research and operational issues related to responsible  technology and fairness with the introduction of a solution powered by  machine learning a scoring algorithm able to identify the most relevant  temporary workers for a job description issued by an employer this  algorithmic solution aims at not only automating how the curriculum  vitæ of a job candidate is parsed and matched with job descriptions and  offers but also how safeguard algorithms designed to try to prevent  some biases and therefore offer less unfair outcomes it seemed  important to us to illustrate how previous work on fairnessbydesign  and responsible technology shaped the research and development of  the job matching algorithm

here we will  use ai to refer machine andor deep learning algorithms able to auto mate and therefore improve quantitatively the job matching process  between jobseekers and job offers over time it also offers qualitative  improvement since algorithms offer the prospect of faster more accu rate and more consistent hrm outcomes thanks to scientific and tech nological insights coming from fields such as natural language  processing nlp as well as behavioural and brain sciences machine  learning is already doing a great job at identifying the skills and moti vation of candidates and at predicting job fit and performance tanash  et al 2019 yoo et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 zhu 2021  as aibased solutions become more popular in hrm and therefore  more influential individuals and organizations that design develop  and implement these solutions must ensure that the innovative solutions  they introduce are ethical and inclusive in order to avoid discriminatory  and unfair outcomes as already observed kochling and wehner 2020  made a review of this field cheng and hackett 2021 conducted a  critical review of algorithms in hrm in other words hr tech must be a  responsible technology  according to stilgoe et al 2013 there are four dimensions of  responsible innovationtechnology anticipation reflexivity inclusion  and responsiveness see also the works of andrews 2019 for an  example of responsible technology policy in the private sector one can  therefore wonder whether hr tech is a responsible technology of  course it is impossible to make a blanket statement over an entire sector  like hr tech even if it is still in its infancy compared to more estab lished ones such as healthcare food and agriculture transportation or  energy yet one can still wonder whether hr tech is making a truly  positive impact on society rather than causing new issues which  would be one of the prerequisites to calling any technology responsible  in order to be deemed responsible hr tech must be ethical and  nondiscriminatory  in business and academia we do hear more and more key players  advocating for innovation to be ethical by design fritz et al 2020  radclyffe and nodell 2020 for dignum et al 2018 ethics by design  concerns the methods algorithms and tools needed to endow autono mous agents with the capability to reason about the ethical aspects of  their decisions and the methods tools and formalisms to guarantee that  an agents behavior remains within given moral bounds as much as we  support this claim it is also our belief that being ethical is mandatory  but  not  sufficient  innovation  must  also  be  inclusive  and  nondiscriminatory in other words it must be fair by design feuer riegel et al 2020 fair by design matching algorithms were built for  various purposes ranging from organ donation garcíasoriano and  bonchi 2020 to judicial selection zhu et al 2018 see also the works  of veale et al 2018 for a discussion on fairness and accountability in  algorithm development it implies that in addition to outcomes being  ethical and therefore within moral bounds algorithms should not  discriminate between individuals and provide as much as possible  equal opportunities in the context of a job matching algorithm previous  work has explored the benefits of a fair by design development of hrm  morgan 2008 yet one can then wonder what it means for an algo rithmic solution to be fair since unfairness comes in many shapes and  forms and its appreciation can be highly context dependent see the  works of robert et al 2020 for a framework that illustrates fair  organizational aibased management solutions  2 responsible artificial intelligence a combination of public  policy and selfregulation  as artificial intelligence became pervasive legitimate concerns  started to grow at the societal level regarding the socalled black box  functioning of aipowered solutions developed for commercial pur poses some of these concerns are justified when the output of algo rithms exhibits obvious biases srinivasan and chander 2021 that lead  to unfairness in the way people are benefiting or not from aiassisted  solutions or worse when the decisions rastogi et al 2020 informed  or taken by ai algorithms lead to obvious discrimination ferrer et al  2021 miller 2020 or mistakes that cannot be easily identified even  when second opinions are required to correct them cabitza 2019 this  issue is key in many business sectors including in human resources  management where automated decisions made by algorithms can have  dramatic consequences on someones professional career pillai and  sivathanu 2020 yano 2017 requiring algorithmic transparency is  necessary to improve the confidence of its users but hard to implement  one of the reasons is the clear tension between businesses wanting to  protect intellectual property that required millions of dollars invested in  research and development and the moral and legal need for trans parency and accountability castetsrenard 2020 meyer and fernan dez 2019  a significant number of companies have taken proactive steps to not  only introduce principles and guidelines golbin and axente 2021  pesenti 2021 pichai 2018 when it comes to using ai but to make  them operational eg microsoft company1 although there is no real  consensus regarding the way these principles are presented or imple mented they should involve epistemic principles and more general  ethical principles castetsrenard 2020 yet although companies  commit genuinely or for public relation risk mitigation purposes to  responsible ai principles there is not yet a standard guiding the road  from principles to implementation and regulation jobin et al 2019  highlight a degree of emerging consensus on this topic  interestingly responsible ai has become a business within the  business professional services firms offer to assist companies in their  implementation of responsible ai principles mills et al 2020 and  specific tech solutions are now available to assist companies such as  credo ai2 offering an endtoend governance platform for managing  compliance and measuring risk for your ai deployments at scale  it is noteworthy that because they are under constant public  opinion media and regulatory scrutiny big tech companies have made  significant and visible efforts to adopt and most of the time implement  responsible ai principles these initiatives although gaining mo mentum are not generalized yet in the startup ecosystem but should  become the norm as soon as possible some small business do their best  to try to fly under the radar when it comes to responsible ai or assess ment of the reality of their ai solutions because of the fake ai issue i  e companies pretending to develop ai solutions when they are not  schmelzer 2020 this is not a sustainable stance from both a busi ness ethical and regulatory perspectives  recently the european commission ec issued proposal 2021  0106cod entitled laying down harmonized rules on artificial intel ligence the artificial intelligence act and amending certain union  legislative acts commision 2021 what is referred to as ecs arti ficial intelligence act was issued to   1 ensure that ai systems placed on the union market and used are safe  and respect existing law on fundamental rights and union values   2 ensure legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in ai   3 enhance governance and effective enforcement of existing law on  fundamental rights and safety requirements applicable to ai systems   4 facilitate the development of a single market for lawful safe and  trustworthy ai applications and prevent market fragmentation  amongst the many points raised transparency obligations for  certain ai systems are highlighted as well guidelines for governance  and implementation while not preventing innovation the ec effort is  to be supported and seems to gain momentum abroad for instance in  november 2010 the us director of the national ai initiative at the  1 wwwmicrosoftcomenusaiourapproachactivetabpivot1primaryr5   2 wwwcredoai  s delecraz et al

the contextdependent perception of fairness  the mere definition of fairness does not meet consensus across all the  academic fields that have investigated it and tried to address the topic  over the past centuries the strong contextdependence of the percep tion of fairness makes it all the more complicated for all stakeholders in  hrm to create or buy fair aibased solutions horak 2018  since this article discusses ai and fairness in the context of auto mated workplace job matching and recruitment processes we thought a  good starting point would be to look at the definition of fairness pro vided by the collins dictionary fairness is the quality of being  reasonable right and just this definition does not take into account  the complexity and multidimensionality of fairness arneson 2016  sabrina strang 2015 in order to get a better idea of the various angles  that can be taken to approach fairness in ai we would advise the reader  to refer to the work of verma and rubin 2018 who collected the most  prominent definitions of fairness for the algorithmic classification  problem explained the rationale behind these definitions and  demonstrated each of them on a single unifying casestudy  mehrabi et al 2021 define fairness as the absence of any prejudice  or favoritism toward an individual or a group based on their inherent or  acquired characteristics of course there are many other definitions of  fairness but from an operational standpoint in our everyday lives  fairness is often a perception and a personal appreciation that one has of  a situation andor the outcomes of a decision at a given moment in  time and in a given social setting getnet et al 2014 like beauty  or  many other judgments that we make on a daily basis  fairness lies in the  eye of the beholder there is therefore a high level of intra and inter personal variability when one needs to address whether a decision is fair  for example jun and yefeng 2015 ramalingam 2010 the reason is  that like many other things in our lives fairness appreciation is  modulated by a multitude of contextual factors such as cultural differ ences level of education or even gender or age petersen et al 2014  witt and nye 1992  fairness can even be associated with a visceral reaction slovic et al  2004 a feeling that us humans could experience following something  that happened in our lives the fairness appreciation and neural pro cessing associated with it is highly contextdependent as illustrated by  studies in philosophy ryan 2006 social psychology van den bos  et al 2003 platow et al 2000 game theory rabin 1993 and more  recently in behavioural economics camerer and loewenstein 2003  social cognitive and affective neuroscience guroglu et al 2010 mor etti and di pellegrino 2010 and neuroeconomics oullier et al 2008  22 unfair tools in human resources management  in human resources management and more particularly in recruit ment and job matching processes the technology that has been the  most popular and widely used over the past decades by organizations is  rooted in questionnaires surveys and tests emre 2018 such declar ative methods are used with the hope of capturing someones person ality traits cognitive abilities and skills but also to provide predictive  insights regarding job fit as well as success or failure in job performance  in other words a series of questions is supposed to unveil the complexity  of a candidates behaviour personality affective reactions skills and  brain functioning but there is a major problem the reliability and  predictive power of recruitment tests has been extensively challenged  since the 1970s when the first peerreviewed articles were published  demonstrating the limitations and flaws of questionnaires and self reports nisbett and wilson 1977  unlike psychological states that evolve over time traits that some  hrm tests claim they can capture should not sensitive to context this  means that any methodology meant to measure personality traits that  would not produce statistically similar outcomes under various contexts  should not be considered fair in our opinion  the most common way to assess the reliability of a personality test is  the testretest approach consisting in taking a given test once and  taking it again some time later this is what some scientists started to do  more than forty years ago with one of the most popular test ever that is  still very much used in hrm nowadays howes and carskadon 1979  even when the testretest interval is short eg 5 weeks as many as  fifty percent of the people will be classified into a different type reports  pittenger 1993 a behavioural scientist and foremost expert in per sonality tests who has extensively published on this topic pittenger  2005  whether for the lack of anything better or because of the impossi bility to implement more rigorous solutions at scale public and private  organizations still rely heavily on declarative methods in human re sources management despite more than forty years of solid scientific  literature highlighting their lack of reliability reproducibility and  predictive power of job fit or performance for nearly fifty years the  professional careers and by extension the professional and personal  lives of millions of individuals have been shaped by the results of such  unfair declarative methods fortunately new more rigorous approaches  are gaining momentum as videobased interviews and analytics  hemamou et al 2019 or gamified assessment protocols nair and  sadasivan 2019 opening doors to potential improvement and reli ability in talent acquisition and recruitment processes especially when  powered by ai eubanks 2022  in addition to the reliability and therefore ethical issues associated  with recruitment tools rooted in declarative methods and selfreports  assessments of the competencies and job fitness of candidates can be  influenced by the state of mind of the recruiters themselves how  stressed recruiters feel while assessing a candidates profile how their  own personal experience relates or not to that of the candidate or how  much they like the technology supposed to assist and even compassion  fatigue are amongst the wealth of factor that can alter their assessments  during a recruitment process anderson 2003 bartone and bowles  2020 huang et al 2013 ivanovic et al 2020 jones 2018 tehrani  2010 poor job matching and recruitment can possibly lead to em ployees experiencing distress mental health issues and bad job perfor mances fordjour et al 2020 another consequence of bad hires not to  be neglected increased financial costs for the recruiting organization  fujita and ramey 2007 this is simply not acceptable  23 towards fair algorithmic job matching outcomes  leveraging the power of large scale data sets and machine learning  algorithms combined with behavioural and brain sciences helps better  understand the skills of people applying for jobs and providing them  with the best job matching service it can help make job offers more  inclusive and less discriminatory however the fact that what was  available before the advent of ai in hrm ie declarative tests see  earlier paragraphs was not only scientifically questionable and ques tioned but unfair does not prevent us from putting the question of  fairness at the core of research and development of the ai and algo rithms powering new hrm solutions it is not just necessary but  mandatory for us to do our best to make the outcomes of our algorithms  as fair as possible  what the incredible body of theoretical and field work on fairness  produced by scholars in so many academic fields reveals how complex it  is to measure interpret model and implement this concept  3 wwwncslorgresearchtelecommunicationsandinformationtechnolog  y2020legislationrelatedtoartificialintelligenceaspx  s delecraz et al                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 journal of responsible technology 11 2022 100041 4 unsurprisingly it has a lead to some differences in the way fairness is  mathematically modelled and implemented versus the human percep tion of fairness as illustrated by the works of srivastava et al 2019 and  of verma and rubin 2018  in the following sections we advocate that a responsible use of ai in  hrm must include machine learningbased feedback and safeguard  mechanisms to prevent automated decisionmaking processes and out comes from being discriminatory unethical and therefore unfair a  responsible hr tech solution should be powered by a new breed of job  matching algorithms and hrm solutions that can significantly improve  matching speed and efficacy and therefore benefit the professional lives  and careers of individuals and the functioning of the organizations  employing them johnson et al 2020 tewari and pant 2020 but in  addition to quantitative performance qualitative safeguards are  mandatory to avoid as best as possible biases in algorithmic decisions  that would lead to discriminatory outcomes  we introduce the methodological approach employed in developing  our matching algorithm between job offers and workers while doing our  best to avoid the pitfall of unfairness and discrimination our approach  to algorithm development is guided by the constant objective of offering  a solution at the cutting edge of technology that has at its core a strict  policy of being as fair and transparent as possible  the job matching algorithm introduced in this article is a tool for  internal recruiters to help them staff their specific request in the mini mum of time its development is driven by three principles   1 to perform the most relevant and responsible recommendations to  match a specific job description   2 to do it in the shortest amount of time   3 to make sure that the algorithm processes the most uptodate  dataset  one of the main concerns is for everyone in our database of job seekers to be provided with equal chances to be recruited regardless  their age gender origin as long as they are the best fit with the job offer  in terms of skills professional experience and education in our  approach the key features should be the workers professional experi ence and motivation the latter being assessed thanks to a combination  of natural language processing and cognitive features embedded in our  algorithm it is noteworthy that focusing on professional experience  would likely disadvantage groups who have fewer years of experience  for example due to pregnancy therefore it is crucial to check whether  the model makes predictions based on the relevance and the quality of  an application and not on other criteria that may be correlated or  confounded an algorithm should not only be considered in light of its  performance and outcomes according to a given set of metrics but also  according to the context in which its outcomes ie the decision it  makes are being used all things considered it is also important to  realize that a fair algorithm does not necessary means that the outcomes  of its decisions are equal  fairness was above all a philosophical and sociological matter before  it became a technological one its study and implementation within the  framework of ai is formalized by the definition of a set of rules and  equations allowing its quantification and verification  not including information such as gender age or birth country  could in some instances contribute to improve the fairness of outcomes  in theory however there are cases such as classification or association  rules where the exclusion of these pieces of information about the  candidate have shown not be effective in order to produce fair outcomes  pedreshi et al 2008 in fact few metrics castelnovo et al 2021 are  particularly used predictive parity verma and rubin 2018 de mographic parity and equalized odds hardt et al 2016 being able to  control for the three aforementioned features turns out to be not only  very difficult but can turn to be counterproductive as illustrated by  kleinberg et al 2017 who provided statistical evidence for their  mutual exclusion in most cases  24 data distribution and bias analysis  we want to ensure that no particular group is discriminated by our  model our proprietary database is constituted of applications made by  temporary workers in france applying for jobs the atomic item is  composed by the set of attributes from a temporary worker the set of  information from the job description to which the work could or would  apply for and a label which describes the outcome of the application 1 if  the worker was recruited 0 otherwise to be consistent with our vision  we focused on sensitive attributes including gender nationality birth  country need for residence permit some foreigners need a residence  permit and education some workers have declared an education but  some did not  we assume for instance that workers who need a residence permit  are more likely to be negatively affected by the model through a bias the  model could find in the database the same thing goes for the other  sensitive attributes therefore we use dummy variables to categorize  what we assume would be a group of candidates that would be fav oured by the algorithm as opposed to the group that would be  discriminated by it    gender male or female    nationality french nationality or not    place of birth born in france or not    education has declared an education level or not    residence permit rp requirement can work without a residence  permit or need to have one    1825 in the 1825 age range or not    2535 in the 2535 age range or not    3545 in the 3545 age range or not    4555 in the 4555 age range or not  we conducted an analysis across these sensitive attributes to assess  the fairness of the outcomes provided by our model using the equal  opportunities notion as defined by the fairlearn toolkit bird et al  2020 before implementing a fair algorithm we analysed the data to  observe possible biases or underrepresentation of some categories  table 1 indicates the size of each population along with every sensitive  attribute broken down in two outcome categories recruited versus not  recruited and by the value of each sensitive attribute assumed to  belong to the favoured group versus discriminated one for instance  we can see that the label has the same distribution no matter the gender  indeed the gap between the number of males that are recruited and  those who are not is not significantly different from the difference be tween the number of recruited females versus the ones who are not  recruited  our goal is to be able to identify some unjustified dependencies be tween outcome group and sensitive attributes in our data set for  instance female candidates are historically less prone to be favoured  compared to male ones in our case to have their job application

the reader is invited to kindly keep in mind that this first  step is not about analysing the model nor its consequences but truly to  highlight unfairness in the data set for the data analysis part we  compute two scores which allow us to appreciate the disparity in  recruitment processes we define a sensitive attribute a which indicates  that one individual belongs to a group considered as discriminated and a  to the privileged group considering variable y to describe the outcome  of the jobseekers application we first computed for each attribute the  disparate impact on the data  disparate impact  py  1a py  1a 1   the first equation expresses a comparison between two probabilities i  the probability for a member of the discriminated group to have the  favourable outcome to be recruited in our case ii the probability for a  member of the favoured group to have the favourable outcome the  second equation is the one to calculate statistical parity  statistical parity  py  1a  py  1a 2   using both disparate impact and statistical parity provides a broader  vision and enables us to find effects that could have been hidden by the  distribution of data  given these equations there is no predetermined threshold neither  by law nor by regulations for which an observation is considered as  biased or not feldman et al 2015 argues that a correct disparate  impact should not be less than 08 and not greater than 125 these  boundaries are based on the 80 rule recommended by the us equal  employment opportunity commission4 regarding statistical parity  without a welldefine threshold in the scientific literature we consider a  gap of 01 too large to be unconsidered in job recruitment for instance  this could mean that a man would have 10 more chance to have his  application chosen table 2 presents these two scores for all the sensitive  attributes we studied  we can see there is no clear imbalance when it comes to age or  gender for these variables disparate impact is quite close to 1 and  statistical parity is close to 0 this means there is no strong under  representation of women among the approved applications compared  to men and vice versa if we consider nationality for instance disparate  impact is particularly low and statistical parity is particularly far below  zero this shows that the frequency of approved job applications for  people who are not french is significantly lower than for french people  we could give the same description for some other variables such as  being born in france education and whether the person does need a  residence permit  here we clearly see that label distribution is not the same across  sensitive attributes the assumed to be the favoured group people of  french nationality usually benefit from the preferred outcome while  foreign applicants get the preferred outcome roughly half of the time  from this analysis and examination of our data we did find biases  and underrepresentation that are identified for not all but a few of the  defined variables rp requirement education nationality and place of  birth our data is based on accurate events and is only meant to describe  human behaviour this does not mean a model trained on this data will  generate discriminatory rules since the model is not informed about  sensitive attributes we do think that this approach represents an  appropriate methodology to understand the data we can also observe  the dependency between the label and the sensitive attribute  25 proposed fairness guidelines  when it comes to supervised learning tasks in a human resources  management context the equality of opportunity metric is often  considered the more relevant one in the scientific literature hardt et al  2016 if y is a binary predictor of the outcome of a worker application  and y the associated ground truth we consider class 1 as the preferred  outcome in the classification task the worker was recruited given a  sensitive attribute a indicating the belonging to a group considered as  discriminated and a the belonging to the favoured group y is consid ered equal opportunity with respect to sensitive attribute a if  py  1y  1 a  py  1y  1 a 3   this equation could also be written in terms of another statistical metric  the true positive rate tpr given the number of true positives tp and  the number of false negatives fn we compute tpr  tptp  fn  which gives us as new formulation of the equation  3  tpra  tpra 31   in light of equation 31 we define the true positive ratio parity as  tprp  tpra  tpra 4   this particular metric shows a couple of advantages   1 it allows the perfectly accurate solution to be right whereas the  demographic parity metric might describe accurate data as inap propriate this fact would not make sense in the context of our work  since we are training a model to approximate the ground truth   2 it compares the ability of the model across groups to select relevant  profiles   3 it penalizes the model who perform well on the majority group  the second point addressed above is particularly important in the  context of job matching and recruitment for instance a hiring agent  would rather select too many candidates than too few if the true positive  rate for males were really higher compared to the true positive rate  for females then the model would either select relevant profiles  amongst males more accurately than female relevant profiles or the  model would select irrelevant male profiles more often than it would  select irrelevant female profiles using this fairness definition is in fact  requiring nondiscrimination only within the preferred outcome one  can see that this vision of fairness is more than a probabilistic equation  because it is linked to an ideology or a philosophical belief the tprp is  not a normalized concept and we are conscious of bias toward what we  consider a meritocratic approach is therefore favoured  ideally we would set a doorstep or a reference value for this metric  an alarm threshold to which we will compare our assessments  however as far as we know there is no clear recommendation or  handbook in the literature on which value to consider therefore we  chose ours somewhat arbitrarily yet based on our own experience the  threshold itself is meant to ensure there is no group who is  table 2  disparate impact and

applications only how  often do we predict correctly those who belong to a group a versus a  group b  251 fairness assessment  after analysing our data the next step consists in evaluating the  impact of our matching model we examined how the model performs  based on the equal opportunity fairness definition in order to have a  broader view on how the model behaves we have chosen to use a  twofold cross validation method to reduce randomness we therefore  computed the average true positive rate parity together with the f1  score and area under the roc curve auc to better understand how  the model behaves  as illustrated in table 3 across every sensitive attribute our model  exhibits fine f1score and auc our model does not make undesirable  decisions in order to have a fair output we can also observe that the  different tprp values reach a maximum 454 for the attribute defining  whether the worker is french or not as mentioned before we do not  have a clear threshold concerning this metric this said a binary vision  where a side of a threshold would be right and the other side wrong is  not necessarily relevant for instance the issue is more to make sure  there is no group that is disproportionately harmed or disadvantaged  compared to another one all tprp scores obtained in output of our  model are below 5 having the trade knowledge in hiring and also by  interacting with experienced inhouse recruiters we consider this  threshold a good baseline for future iteration of the model at the core of  our machine learning solution  252 unfairness mitigation  in our approach to developing fair algorithms we embraced general  artificial intelligence fairness and ethics guidelines hagendorff 2020  but we also needed to consider technical mitigation techniques several  approaches have already been introduced  hardt et al 2016 proposed to achieve equal opportunity by  deriving a given predictor such an approach bears interesting advan tages including being model insensitive and focusing on optimizing  equal opportunity outcomes while keeping an attractive loss function  compared to the predictor it is derived from but it also requires to  constantly include the sensitive attribute in every step this is not ideal  for us since we have many missing values in the real world application of  our model preprocessing interventions were proposed to transform the  data in order to reduce correlations calmon et al 2017 feldman et al  2015 however these techniques are meant to mitigate any excess in  the true positive rate parity and are not the most relevant when  considering an equal opportunity definition  a promising approach was introduced by agarwal et al 2018 the  exponential gradient algorithm for unfairness reduction appears to be  the most relevant one as far as we are concerned the model performs  good results for a classification task moreover this method benefits  from requiring the sensitive attribute in the training part only this  approach is particularly attractive in a context where we are concerned  by deployment problems and issues  the remaining problem is that we still need sensitive attributes in our  process therefore implementing and deploying this approach in our  machine learning rd pipelines would mean to train the model on a  subset of our database this would not be coherent with one of the  principles at the core of machine learning fairness diversity schu mann 2020 avoiding missing values means reducing diversity some  missing data might provide information that is key to better profile  groups of individuals  3 a realistic framework for algorithmic fairness  hoping for ai to be objective neutral or unbiased does not make any  sense since objectivity neutrality and unbiased simply do not exist  what responsible technology should be expected to do is to provide the  most rigorous and transparent methodology to provide a service or to  reach a certain outcome and a set of principles coupled with actionable  guidelines to implement them while complying to existing regulatory  measures and upcoming ones is necessary above and beyond it is  mandatory to put fairness and human wellness and safety at the core of  the thought design and implementation processes when it comes to  responsible aipowered hrm solutions  as creators of artificial intelligence and machinelearning based so lutions in the hr tech sector to help people find the best professional fit  it is our duty not only to understand but to be able to explain and justify  all the decisions made by our algorithms these decisions must be  methodologically and scientifically rigorous as well as evidence  informed  although the work focusing on defining and studying fairness with a  multidisciplinary approach dates back to the 1960s hutchinson and  mitchell 2019 the interest in machine learning research in this area  has only really boomed in the mid 2010s caton and haas 2020 as  raghavan et al 2020 points out in their article it can be difficult for an  external entity to study the fairness of the models used by a company  and the often sensitive and proprietary data that the models are  crunching it is therefore key for the effort on fairness to be embedded as  soon as the first mathematical models are created  van den broek et al 2020 acknowledge how complex it is to take  fairness issues into account in recruitment processes but they also offer  interesting guidelines to considering when one wants to build respon sible and fair ai see the works of jobin et al 2019 and floridi and  cowls 2019 for a unified framework of principles for ai in society  one of the biggest misconceptions about ai is that it is meant to do  things better than a human in a lot of cases it does but ai should be  developed to do things differently humans make mistakes and part of  the social contract across centuries has been to monitor correct  anticipate and sometimes punish when these mistakes are made there  is also a form of understanding if not tolerance for some of these mis takes algorithms are not humans hence our tolerance for algorithmic  mistakes should be lower than our tolerance for human error for a  significant portion of them algorithms are developed by humans or by  other algorithms that at one point were developed by humans  the human factor comes with greatness and flaws such as biases yet  as addressed in some of our previous work oullier and basso 2010 it is  a profound mistake to consider human biases as an exception to a  rational norm biases are everywhere whether we like it or not they  are the norm more than they are the exception it is not a good thing it is  not a bad thing it is just how humans behave despite what supporters of  a rational approach to economic theory have been disseminating for  over a century this means that data collected on humans and their  behaviours are intrinsically biased hence in addition to addressing the  issue of biased algorithms and their unfair outcomes it is necessary to  address the issues related to biased data sets  it is therefore our duty in hr tech as in any other ai system not  only to be aware of these issues but to make sure that we build the right  regulations  enforced by regulatory bodies and policymakers as well as  table 3  evaluation of the performance and fairness of our workerjob offer

  journal of responsible technology 11 2022 100041 7 by companies and individuals themselves  and the right technology for  the solutions that are released to be fair  finally it is important to bear in mind that despite its performance  we are constantly working at improving the main algorithm introduced  in this article as well as the safeguard algorithms in charge of control ling for biases at this stage of its development our algorithm is not the  decision maker but a tool to assist human recruiters in their decision  making process the final decision still comes to a human being when  it comes to matching a cv with a job offer to take human factors that ai  cannot yet factor in yet the algorithms competitive advantage lies in  the speed and amount of cvs it can analyse and select to help the  recruiter  4 conclusion  in the context of human resources management we introduced an  approach to research and development of artificial intelligence algo rithms that can predict who the best candidate is for a given job offer  while controlling for the fairness of its outcomes we did identify biases  across the process that led to a differential treatment of individuals  some being favoured some being discriminated as well biases towards  some sensitive information such as owning a resident permit having a  certain level of education and coming from a certain birthplace  in light of these biases we have introduced metrics to assess the level  of unfairness in this hrm solution that can correct the outcome to make  it fairer what we did is embedding in our aibased automation process  algorithmic safeguards that are informed by possible biases theory and  measured ones outcomes in order to make the decisions made by our  machine learning algorithm in charge of automating the matching be tween job applicants and job offers as fair as possible  this is the first step in a series of rd phases where regardless of the  task to be automated fairness will be measured and algorithmic out comes will be corrected if our safeguard algorithms estimate that fair ness is not observed this not only allows to ensure a higher level of  fairness in the outcomes provided by our algorithms but also to improve  transparency and explainability of what our algorithms decide  declaration of competing interest  the authors declare the following financial
